Well, I&#8217;ve [been using iPhoto][1], Lightroom in it&#8217;s different beta stages and now I had a demo of Aperture. I&#8217;ve been shooting digital for quite some time now, and scanned lots of negatives from when I still shot film and my parents before me. My collection is about 35.000 pictures, spanned over many DVDs and CDs. Pictures that are virutally inaccessible because I don&#8217;t know where they are. So I decided a while back to throw them all into a harddrive and try out different programs.

First program I had to ditch was iPhoto. Even iPhoto 6 becomes unusable after about 5000 pictures. It&#8217;s just ghastly slow on my Macbook Pro 15&#8243; 2,33Ghz Core 2 Duo with 2GB RAM. So that&#8217;s inexcusable.

Second program was Lightroom, after about 10.000 photos it was very slow. At 16.000 photos it grinded to a halt. Not even half way there. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> A shame, really, as I really liked Lightroom and had high hopes for it, I have now abandoned it.

I grabbed a demo of aperture, and hit a very convenient limit. Where Lightroom and iPhoto just died more and more, Aperture said: <quote>  
Aperture has max 10000 pictures  
Aperture projects are limited to 10000 master images each. You should create new projects and import your images in batches of less than 10000.</quote>  
Quite convenient, really

So, what do I do now? Shooting mainly RAW I don&#8217;t suppose changing to [F-Spot][2] is much of an alternative, especially since it&#8217;s proved quite inaccessible on OS X. I guess I&#8217;ll have to talk with the crowd that uses iView Media Pro and see how it fares. Do you have any other recommendations?
