Hi, I&#8217;m a new co-author to this blog and early music is quite new to me although i have played it all my life. I am mostly puzzled, stupiefied and amazed by the things possible (and impossible) in early music and i hope my startlement will only increase as more early music reveals itself before my anxious eyes and fingers.

I&#8217;m actually an organist that recently threw my energy on the harpsichord. I now play many kinds of music with many different people. I&#8217;m happy to discover that many techniques used on the organ can be used on the harpsichord too (and many cannot &#8211; still happy, and learning). I hope you will find your time to comment and discuss my following post on these and many other matters concerning early music.

Happy blogging
