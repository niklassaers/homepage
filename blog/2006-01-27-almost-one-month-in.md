Hi, I thought I&#8217;d give you a heads-up on what&#8217;s happening with the blog. It&#8217;s now almost one month ago that the blog officially came up on <a href="http://earlymusicblog.net" class="broken_link">http://earlymusicblog.net</a> and we&#8217;ve added a number of features. We&#8217;ve now got the most recent scores from the [Werner Icking Music Archive][1] linked in the sidebar, a number of blogs linked up and their resent posts linked and made bookmarking on different bookmarking services up and running. Not to mention a little set of entries and a couple of design changes.

So what are the goals for the next month? Getting active co-authors and improving the blog further, and finding more blogs to link up. So please post your early music blog link as a comment here and I&#8217;ll add it quickly. If you&#8217;d like to become an author, send me an email. There are already a handful of co-authors that are gearing up to submit their first article. Stay tuned for yet an interesting month! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
