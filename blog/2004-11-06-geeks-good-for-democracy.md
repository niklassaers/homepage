At Kurohin they are [double-checking the numbers][1] and drawing their connclusions from the US election. Although I haven&#8217;t thought the American voting system a suitable tool for a democracy, it is a boost that people can and do verify the numbers. More openness of election data and the data presented in open formats will only help us understand the democracies better. Keep up the good work, whoever is behind this. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

(PS, computerizing elections doesn&#8217;t mean people won&#8217;t screw up, as [Wired can attest to][2])
