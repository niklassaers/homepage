So, this blog now uses the Kubrick team, even though I&#8217;m having a couple of problems with it. So I did a quick [google][1] to see how many admitted to using it, and I thought I&#8217;d link up a few here. I won&#8217;t comment on the ones that haven&#8217;t made any real changes, but since I&#8217;m planning to I thought I&#8217;d see what other people have been doing.

<a href="http://freshnecessity.net/blog/" class="broken_link">FreshNecessity</a> has done a nice thing with different backgrounds for each heading and added a couple of options on top. Much like I was thinking about. He uses iPap for his photo albums. Maybe I should check it out. I&#8217;m using [Gallery][2] and I haven&#8217;t looked too much into making it work with the same theme yet.

[ChopSocky][3] did a nice thing with the right-side bar.

<a href="http://adampoulemanos.com/" class="broken_link">Cultural Collision</a> tries having a menu on top, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s just there yet.
