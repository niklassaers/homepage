Today I&#8217;m starting a little series of 18 pictures called &#8220;Flowers & Bees&#8221;. First one out I sent to my girlfriend, called *With love from me to you*. All the pictures are taken either in my mums garden or the playingfield next to it. This particular one is from the field, and as you can see me and my lens were quite bombarded with pollen by the time this picture was taken. It would have been nice if the picture was more focussed, at 1/100 second it was still to shaky for my 100mm macro and a 2x converter.
