Wee&#8230; for those who think they are on a good mobile phone plan, I just had 4,02 kr back (about 50 US cent, a little less than an australian dollar) and got 5m30sec worth of phone time being very nervous that I should be interrupted and not being able to refill. Mobile phones are a lot more fun in Denmark than in Norway where I&#8217;d have payed about 20kr for the same call.
