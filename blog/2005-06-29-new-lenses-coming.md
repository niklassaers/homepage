I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens I ordered today. I finally found [a review][1] of it, and it sounds good. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> After reading a bunch of [reviews][2] of the Tamron 28-75, I&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;ll replace my trusty Canon 28-80mm f/3.5-4.5.
