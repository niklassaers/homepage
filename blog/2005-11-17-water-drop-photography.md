I&#8217;ve been reading up on <a href="http://www.liquidsculpture.com/faq/faq.htm" class="broken_link">liquid sculpture</a> about how to make water drop photos, and my conclusions so far is that the equipment is to expensive, but I&#8217;ll have a chat with some friends over christmas when I get back to Norway. For the moment, read <a href="http://www.liquidsculpture.com/Articles/OutbackPhoto/OutbackPhoto_2005_10.htm" class="broken_link">this</a> and [this][1] interview on the topic. There are lots of great photos included!
