I&#8217;m so happy I took the consequences of the [last failure trying to fly Norwegian/Sterling][1] that I now flew with Cimberair. The service was swift and great! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> However, [Norwegian is still trying to mess up their customers&#8217; lives][2] (Norwegian link there). Same trouble as last time. What is it with these guys? They make Ryan Air look like choir boys.
