I&#8217;m making OSC controllers for the iPhone, and I just sat down to check out the competition. Some projects, like TouchOSC and OSCemote are for pay. However, they are both out-competed on features and looks by Mrmr by Eric Redlinger. His version is soo much closer to what I have in mind, implements all the features by the two others and is free. That&#8217;s a mighty good package you have there, Eric.

Status on my week is that I&#8217;m not to fond of doing the web-bit, so I&#8217;m not giving myself any exposure either. The functionality is coming nicely together for the apps, and I&#8217;m starting to get a couple of beta-testers, but I&#8217;ll probably spend some time finding a couple more. Right now I really need a graphics artist and someone who enjoys doing CSS <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
