I <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=3841610983&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT" class="broken_link">bought a 2x teleconverter</a> from [47st.photo ][1] at [eBay][2] in September. The seller has until now not made even what I can consider an attempt on solving the issue, so I&#8217;ve given up, and hereby report the issue to eBay. I also write this as a warning of people who consider doing business with this company. Don&#8217;t do business with them unless you can walk in the door and hold the actual product.

The item I was bidding for was this: *Canon EOS Rebel K2 Ti GII 7n 2x Pro Telephoto Extender* and it had the following picture on eBay:  
![2X Telephoto][3]  
This item is what I got:  
<a href="http://blog.saers.com/photos/test/IMG_9192.jpg" class="broken_link"><img src="http://blog.saers.com/photos/albums/test/IMG_9192.thumb.jpg" alt="Macro/Fisheye lens" /></a>  
As you can see, it clearly sais **macro** and **0.42X**, not tele, not 2x.

I contacted the seller as he had requested in writing before leaving feedback. Any decent person would. I described the problem detailed, but the answer back was a one-liner: *hello this is the same lens*. (entire mailing history <a href="/wp-content/upload/47thst.eml" class="broken_link">enclosed</a> for your inspection) After more one-sided mailing to a non-responsive seller, they finally wrote to me asking me to call them. I&#8217;d already left them my phone number in case they could not communicate by email, but they clearly could. With them sending the wrong item, it was unreasonable for them to demand that I should bear the expense of an oversees call, much less wait for them to get up in the morning. These are some of the wonders of email: asynchronous and (virtually) free.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the people handled the shipment in due time and all the &#8220;free, bundled&#8221; stuff was there. I&#8217;m sure it was a glitch in the shipment, but they should take responsability and handle the replacement for the correct lens. After more than a month, I have now given up on them and desided to write this. I&#8217;ve bought a 2x extender from another seller on eBay, and the transaction went smooth, just like all my other buys there. I would not discourage people from buying stuff there, but beware. I have now stopped looking at items sold in US dollars and will only buy from within the European community and Scandinavia.
