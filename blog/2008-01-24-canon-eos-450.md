The Canon EOS 450 [was announced today][1], and now DPReview has made [a preliminary review][2] of it. I&#8217;m sad it doesn&#8217;t go past 1600 ISO. Nikon is going for high ISOs now, and Canon has pretty much stood still since I bought my 20D. My wish for the next camera (Canon 50D?) is higher ISO with low noise (low noise at 6400 ISO, boost ISO to 25600 ISO. I can dream, can&#8217;t I? But Nikon has low noise up to 3200 ISO so Canon should do its best to do better) and sensor-based image stabilizing. If you need to cut back, Canon, I can do without live view. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
