One and a half hour ago, I had my first cup of fishmeal mixed with water. It was such a shock I almost vomited, and I still feel it crawling up, trying to get out of my stomache. Not delicate at all. I was aware that the taste and smell was repulsive, but I can&#8217;t have mixed it out allright, &#8217;cause it felt like sand mixed with water. Ugh&#8230; oh well, at least I&#8217;m prepared for my next cup tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be sure to have a good cup of coffee around, then. Now I had only chewing gum, and I assure you that there&#8217;s no amount of gum to chew that can instantly make the taste and feel in your body go away. I&#8217;m taking it on the recommendation of a father of a friend of mine who&#8217;s a nutrition researcher. Together with a couple of tablets, this should help protect my arms and my general wellbeing. I&#8217;m quite convinced this is a good thing, but ugh&#8230;
