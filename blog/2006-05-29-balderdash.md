I&#8217;m reading lots of student reports these days (their exams are coming up soon), and in one I found a very interesting word: balderdash. Not quite knowing the meaning of it (I know it&#8217;s a game, but from the context it wasn&#8217;t the game that was talked about) I looked it up, and from [Weird Words I found][1] a funny little quote from the 1766: *That which is made by the peasants, both red and white, is generally genuine: but the wine-merchants of Nice brew and balderdash, and even mix it with pigeonsâ€™ dung and quick-lime*. This adjective is also used as a verb, in addition to the substantive being [the game][2].
