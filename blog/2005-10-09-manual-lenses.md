In [my photoblog][1] I&#8217;ve started a series on manual lenses. The first lens out is a Hanimex 72-162mm f/3.5 lens with a FD mount that I&#8217;m using with my Canon EOS 20D and a FD-EOS adapter. It&#8217;s my defacto concert-lens and I&#8217;ll be starting off with a series of concert pictures. Next up is a MIR-1 37mm f/2.8 M42 mount lens. Be sure to follow the photoblog for the next couple of days and see if you find these lenses usable. I&#8217;ve payed Â£10 for the 72-162mm and $20 for the MIR-1 through eBay, so perhaps you&#8217;ll find that you can have great lenses for a bargain! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Then again, perhaps you&#8217;ll conclude that it&#8217;s a waste of time and money and be glad that I tested this and not you. Let me know what you think!
