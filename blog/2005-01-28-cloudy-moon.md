Yay, I&#8217;ve got my camera back. That is, my camera went in for service to get the 13 detected hot pixles (or whatever the correct term is), but the repair guys forgot to put in the battery when they gave it back. To make things harder, I live in Denmark, the repair shop is in Norway. But one month later, I&#8217;ve got it back, and they&#8217;ve done a good job changing the cmos.

Anyways, I ended up taking a lot of pictures with my 100mm f/2.8 macro, and while this is quite unfocussed, it ended up having the atmosphere I wanted. I have no tripod and I&#8217;ve given my father back his 300mm f/4 that I used for my previous moon shot, but I had to try this one out to see if it was any good. I took a few at lower ISO settings that got more details of the moon, but they reduced the lighting on the clouds. I&#8217;ve got to play more with GIMP or Photoshop Elements.
