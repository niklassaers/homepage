Went through a bunch of old junk and found my old SIM card from when I lived in Brisbane. Popped it into my iPhone, luckily I had disabled the PIN code. Settings, Mail-Contacts-Calendar, Import SIM Contacts&#8230; voila, I have my REALLY old phone book back. I wonder if those guys still have the same numbers. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
