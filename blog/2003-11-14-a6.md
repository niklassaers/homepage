So, now I have to make sure Tomcat fires up all right all the time and  
that the cat rebooting (don&#8217;t you just love that idea? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) works all  
right for users tweaking their system. Then I&#8217;ll hopefully have time  
for the dummynet implementation. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
