The one thing I don&#8217;t get with showers is why there always is water left in them. I mean, I get the physics of it, I just don&#8217;t understand why I can&#8217;t just press a little lever on the shower battery and make the remaining water flow out in the drain. Then I can be sure that no water will slowly go out of my shower and make a damp bathroom, chalk stains or grow bacteria after I&#8217;m done showering.
