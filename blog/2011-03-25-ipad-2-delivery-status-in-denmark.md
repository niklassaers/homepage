Like many of you, this morning I went on the Apple Store online and ordere my iPad 2. I&#8217;ve had a chat with many shop keepers today, both Eplehuset, Elgiganten and Humac. What seems to be the genereal consensus is that less than 10% of the iPads they had asked for have been delivered. So there is a major shortage. My idea was that Apple would prioritize their own channels, but my order from early this morning when they opened is scheduled for delivery in more than a month! So I guess I was wrong, and just like so many others I&#8217;ll just have to wait&#8230;
