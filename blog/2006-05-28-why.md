  <p>Mogens keeps reminding me to update my photoblog and I would very much like to, so the big question is: why the wait? Well, the usual reasons I'm afraid: too much work, too much study, exams coming up, lots of dancing and practicing and spending my time with my girlfriend. The server also gave me headaches that I had to figure out first, so it's just been pushed back. Sorry about that. I haven't stopped snapping, but it's been less than usual. But I still have a nice backlog of photos to post, so they'll be coming shortly.<br /></a><br /></a>
