  <p>This is Bjarke in action with Martin at his side. I only brought along the 50mm f/1.4 lens to the concert as I planned on dancing quite a bit. It's always good fun dancing with the camera on my back, but their bug, rock, cha-cha and swing was too excelent not to. Shot with f/1.4 at 1600 ISO in 1/250 second.<br /></a><strong>Update:</strong> I submitted this as my entry to the <a href="http://www.spunwithtears.com/thursday.html">Thursday Challenge</a>: Sound</p>
