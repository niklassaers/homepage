Having slept on it and digested a lot of articles, these are my comments on the iPhone announced yesterday:

- It runs OS X. In my book that means a BSD platform. I&#8217;m looking forward to having this confirmed. I so miss having BSD on my mobile. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  
- WiFi &#8211; thank you  
- Cool browsing interface due to CoreAnimation &#8211; great! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  
- No UMTS/3G? Yes, we all know 3G is slow, but EDGE is way slower. What&#8217;s up? I really hope the European version will sport 3G  
- 2MP camera? Come on, Apple, that is SO last year!! I thought Apple was supposed to set a standard other would come running after  
- Max 8GB disk? Ok, fair enough, but you already have that out on the market and have had it for a while. Look at Ritek & co, they just announced 16 and 32GB solid state discs  
- Why is it not possible to buy music on the run? When I&#8217;m over at my friends&#8217; place and we talk about music, I&#8217;d love to be able to get the tune right away. But it seems I can&#8217;t buy it from iTunes. (I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll fix this soon enough, though <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )  
- I must admit I&#8217;m skeptical towards the QWERTY keyboard on-screen with no tactile feedback, but I&#8217;m looking forward to giving it a spin and see what it does for me.  
- Google Maps is great! But I already have that on my Nokia 6280.

Further things I&#8217;d like to know: is there a camera connector for it? And if so, does the internal software support RAW?

Now, I&#8217;m cautious about one thing: warranty. Apple has a reputation to refuse to repair iPods that have been handled extremely nice. I don&#8217;t handle stuff nice. My Ericsson mobile phone drowned when I took a dive in the ocean, not long after my Palm 3e took a fly through the air and landing on the floor in an awkward position after being out drinking. I figured I&#8217;d smack it all into one, and got the Sony/Ericsson P800 which got a dint in the screen a year after I got it. Figuring I&#8217;d only go with cheap stuff from now on, my Nokia 6280 has survived a few rides through the air with no problem. They are even making sports versions that are extra protected. I&#8217;m always doing something, always in action, and the stuff that I take along gets a trip trough the air occasionally. So, I&#8217;m really going to be looking at how fragile these phones will be. If they&#8217;re not, I might just spend the $599 for one. Probably in its 2nd iteration, though
