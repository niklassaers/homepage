  <p>I'm sorry for the interruption in my daily posting schedule, but I'm submitting this picture for Photo Friday's Imperfection challenge. I just received the 100mm Promaster Macro lens and had it fitted on my bellows. Finally my manual macro shooting set is complete. My <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/2005/10/20/glass-horse/">previous try at shooting this horse</a> was with the <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/category/manual-focus-lenses/58mm/">58mm M42 lens</a></p>
