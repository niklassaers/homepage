I must admit I&#8217;m getting confused with which roast is which. The two cups I&#8217;ve tried this morning have both been what I believe is 160C &#8211; 5m, 190C &#8211; 4m. It&#8217;s very light, smells very nice like chocolate, but with both cups I&#8217;ve had (grinded at 5 and then 8) they have been acidy like regular coffee, watery like regular coffee and no more taste. The last cup had a decent amount of crema, but that just goes to show that you can have crema without taste.
