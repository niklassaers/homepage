Where do the lines go for what&#8217;s too much intrusion into someone&#8217;s life? [This guy][1] has found a memory card in a taxi, and says: *I am going to post one of your pictures each day. I will also narrates as if I were you.* Apparently so that this person can get back to him and reclaim his/her memory-card. Why does this remind me of blackmail?
