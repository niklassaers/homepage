  <p>This is my first picture in my series of pictures taken with a Canon EOS 20D and old manual-focus lenses. My first lens out is a Hanimex 72-162mm f/3.5 FD-mount lens that I use with an adapter that gives 1.26x magnification. This is my defacto concert-lens, the range is just perfect for the matter. This picture was taken at ISO 800 in 1/60 seconds without flash</p>
