  <p>Every Monday we go to Dronning Louise and drink beer that our local bartender, Chris, has found for us. November 7th he'd dug up Eku beer from the october fest. After christmas I expect we'll be drinking christmas ale until easter, and after easter I'm looking forward to the easter ale. :-) Shot at f/2.8 with 1600 ISO in 1/60 second at a 75mm distance.</p>
