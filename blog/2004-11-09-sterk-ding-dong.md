In an attempt to say what beer is approved for more consumption and what is not, I&#8217;ve started taking pictures of it, with good help from the rest of the Monday Drinking Club. Martin is inspecting the fisheye lens (more for that complaint in a future post), but Fuglesang&#8217;s &#8220;Sterk Ding Dong&#8221; is a well-approved christmas ale. Enjoy!
