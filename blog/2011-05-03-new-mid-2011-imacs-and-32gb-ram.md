So today they released the new iMac. Still no reviews so I have no clue whether I was right or wrong about the chipset. So I&#8217;ve started looking into another pet topic of mine: RAM. I really would like these machines to take a bucket-load of RAM, but Apple still limits themselves to 16GB.

OWC shipped 32GB kits for the last version, and [in this blog comment they confirm they expect it to work well on the current iMac as well][1]. In fact, they [already sell 32GB kits for the 27&#8243; iMacs][2], but at almost $3000!

So far I haven&#8217;t seen people report on the previous generation iMac any brand of RAM that would supposedly work but didn&#8217;t, and [Amazon has a kit for $817][3] that I would expect to work. But no reports yet, so this&#8217;ll have to be investigated.

**Update:** Disregard the amazon-link, the iMacs need 204-pin SO-DIMM DDR3 RAM running at 1333 Mhz. The Amazon link was 240-pin
