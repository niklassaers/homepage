As announced in the end of january, the price for [Well Tempered has increased][1], and will continue to do so for the next couple of months. If you want it at a reduced price, be sure to get it now before the next price increase.

[Well Tempered][1] is an early music tuner for the iPhone. It has lots of baroque and renaissance temperaments that are configurable for any key. The sound shapes it has available makes it so that it can be used pleasurably with soft instruments such as the bass recorder, and be heard through louder instruments such as the cello, even when placed on the notestand quite far from the cellist ear.
