I must admit I&#8217;m dead tired today. I think perhaps I&#8217;m getting the cold everyone here at the con seems to have had. Only thing is I had it last week. Oh well, the amount of heat I&#8217;m producing will save me the heating bill. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Anyways, been a Good Boy(tm) and practised my hours today, been in the choir, and been working on the Zope implementation at REGISTRAR. Put up a little test blog just to see that it is really working like it should. Now I&#8217;ve got to do some reading and learn some Zope as I&#8217;m sure users are going to expect I know all about it. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
