<a href="http://blog.photoblogs.org/2004/10/single_vs_multi.html" class="broken_link">Jake at Photoblogs</a> asks if we loose a way of telling a story by using single-shot photoblogs rather than multi-shot. So here&#8217;s why I do single:

The picture I choose best represent my mood, feelings, thoughts and/or highlights of the day. Doing multiple shots I feel would be saying too much. By going through the shots day by day, perhaps you&#8217;ll get to know me well, but by multiple shots you&#8217;ll have no idea what I most want to focus on as I&#8217;m probably all over the place.

Secondly, of course, is the time issue. I don&#8217;t get to take that many good pictures as I&#8217;m still learning. And processing them takes time. Time comes coupled with space: I don&#8217;t have unlimited with space to publish everything. (although some would say I&#8217;m fairly close <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )

No, I&#8217;ll save those multiple shots for photo albums, such as [my gallery][1]. But having said that, there are multi-shots photoblogs that I read every time a new picture has been added, and one of them is on my top 3. So choose your format, wrap it nicely and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing it. (yes, by all means, do leave an URL in your comment)
