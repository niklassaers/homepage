I&#8217;ve finally taken the plunge: La Pavoni Professional, Rancillo Rocky and iRoast 2 are all lined up on my kitchen counter. Espresso heaven, here I come. Now, what&#8217;s missing is what I can&#8217;t buy: my skills. I have had a $50 espresso machine and a $10 grinder so far, and after 500 cups served it can only produce burnt water (you won&#8217;t know it until you&#8217;ve tasted it), but after this I was sure I wanted something that could make a real cup where I could taste something new.

Well, this was certainly new. I&#8217;ve experimented a week with the Pavoni (it arrived a week before the roaster and grinder) and not been able to get a single cup with crema using Lavazza, Illy and extra fine grinded espresso coffee from my local coffee seller. So I was really looking forward to the grinder. Having very excited opened it and followed the instructions, my first cup with Colombia Supremo from FÃ¸tex turned out to have very little Crema (but still more than with my previous cups) but an incredible taste. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I was starting to believe.

Next step: roasting. I know nothing about roasting, but the iRoast 2 comes with two presets: light and dark. Figuring I&#8217;d try what it suggested first, I roasted some Espresso Miscela d&#8217;Oro from Risteriet at preset 2 &#8211; dark, and put it in a paper bag overnight. It smelt very burnt so I was afraid I&#8217;d overdone it.

Day 2 I wanted to taste it, even though I was skeptical of how burnt it was. Grind, press: there&#8217;s crema! Lots more than I&#8217;ve had before, although nothing compared to the pictures I&#8217;ve seen. The taste? Great! Really, really great. No bitterness, and all I&#8217;ve heared about a sweet cup of coffee, I just understood what they meant. And this was after one day, I&#8217;ve read peak taste will be at day 4 or 5. Can&#8217;t wait. To make the day after more interesting, I roasted a handful of greens at preset 1 &#8211; light.

Day 3 &#8211; the dark coffee is still very good. The light one I haven&#8217;t come around yet as I want to give my tastebuds a chance to go into neutral again. So meanwhile I&#8217;m surfing the net to learn what others think of roasting with this machine to see if I can get a third alternative and what I should think about when I&#8217;m tasting the next cup. Can&#8217;t wait! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
