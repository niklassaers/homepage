Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be at Canon&#8217;s authorized repair-shop to have them look at my 20D. It&#8217;s got what I think is hot pixels even at indoors shooting at 1 second shots. Not good.

There are quite [a][1] [number][2] [of][3] [programs][3] and articles on [reducing noise][4] in digital images.

Oh, and thank you Alan Briot for your [EOS 300D][5] diary. It&#8217;s a great read, and introduced me to [Lens baby][6] ([review][7]). I&#8217;ll be experimenting more with my new 100mm f2.8 macro, though. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> But these babies look like very fun toys. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
