Airtunes is/was Apple&#8217;s way of putting music in other rooms. It came with the Airport Express, but [when the Airport Extreme was updated, Airtunes was nowhere to be found][1]. Worse, [Airtunes can only be streamed to one target?!?][2] Now that Apple has released yet two new WiFi audio products, the iPod touch and the iPhone, why does they not include Airtunes capabilities? They should be able to both stream music and have music streamed to them! Apple, where is Airtunes heading? I still want the same music in every room of my apartment.
