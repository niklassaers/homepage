Cool, seems Apple is backing Eclipse by putting it as a featured tool on their web: [Eclipse and Mac OS X: A Natural Combination][1]. I used Eclipse a while ago and loved it, but on OS X it was too slow to use for anything worthwhile. I hope this has changed in the last half year, 3.1M2 is downloading right now.
