I was at the [jazz festival][1] in Kongsberg friday together with a good friend of mine from <a href="http://odu.meg.nu" class="broken_link">ODU</a>. There I met a friend I lived with in Australia and a friend from secondary school and his girlfriend. Good stuff. We got to see Bobby McPhee at <a href="http://www.kongsberg-jazzfestival.no/default.asp?uid=77&CID=44#CatoSalsa" class="broken_link">The Thing w/McPhee & Cato Salsa Experience</a> and Palace of Pleasure, although with the last concert I loved the warmup band while [PoP][2] didn&#8217;t really perform but sing and play bass to playback-only. Not much of a performance. Today is cancled for my part as I had to go back to Oslo to fix a server that crashed during the night. Bugger! (the damned thing ran out of swap and locked out all) We had a couple of concerts lined up and it&#8217;d been fab being there. The feel of the place was great. Everyone was friendly and outgoing and we got to chat with heaps of nice people. Wish I could&#8217;ve stayed.
