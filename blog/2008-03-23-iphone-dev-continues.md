My work with the iPhone SDK continues, working on three clients to our backend services at the moment. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to blogging about this as it&#8217;s cleared at work. But as you probably have noticed from my posts, working locally and synchronizing with the back-end is what I believe most iPhone applications are about. Do quick and stuff you need to remember on the iPhone, work out the details from your computer, keep everything in sync. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited about Google&#8217;s data integration. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited about integrating SQLite. That&#8217;s why I spend a lot of time working with SOAP integration. And of course, it&#8217;s all good fun. I&#8217;m tempted to say that working with a back-end is a lot easier than doing everything local. At least the satisfaction of seeing the work you do on the little screen influencing the real world is a lot better than it just influencing that screen. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

One thing I&#8217;m miffed about, though, is the NDA. They&#8217;ve got a 100,000 downloads, and if 1/20t of this is developers, then that&#8217;s still 5,000 developers. Where are they all? I can&#8217;t find much going on on discussion boards, forums, mailing-lists or whatever. And Apple is only slowly letting them in to their community. I hope they&#8217;ll let us in soon, I want to discuss problems I&#8217;m having without having people with briefcases coming after me, I want to know what other people are working on, I want the development to be more social. Right now, it&#8217;s mostly a one-man game, and that&#8217;ll get old very soon
