I&#8217;m replacing the seals on my La Pavoni Europiccula, and I found <a href="http://www.pavoniexpress.com/sealrepl.html" class="broken_link">these instructions</a> on how to do it from <a href="http://www.pavoniexpress.com/" class="broken_link">How to Operate, Maintain, and Repair Your la Pavoni Espresso Machine</a>. Good stuff, very helpful. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Together with <a href="http://lapavoni.it/swf/esploso2.htm" class="broken_link">La Pavoni&#8217;s part overview</a> (<a href="http://lapavoni.it/swf/esploso1.htm" class="broken_link">the first page</a>), it was a real help. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Only thing I couldn&#8217;t do was replace the mini rubber gasket because I don&#8217;t have <a href="http://www.pavoniexpress.com/ringpliers.jpg" class="broken_link">ring pliers</a>.
