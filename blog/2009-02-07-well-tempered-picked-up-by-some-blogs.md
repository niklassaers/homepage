Zicos have [picked up][1] the [Well Tempered iPhone application][2] after [a feature in Synthtopia][3]. The article was also [tweeted about][4]. Well Tempered was also featured on [iPod Touch Fans][5] by the App Store Bot. Nice to see it being picked up <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
