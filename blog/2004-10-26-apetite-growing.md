After reading on [a nice, Brazillian island][1], my apetite for going out travelling is growing again. Although I&#8217;d still prefer backpackers&#8217; accommodation. $100 a night that was suggested for this island is a bit stiff in my opinion. Hmm&#8230; where to next? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
