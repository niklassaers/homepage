I&#8217;ve been toying around a bit with my blog, just to see how it works  
and to provoke the code a bit to get more experience with managing  
webapps. So far, things seem to be working well. I just need the URL  
changed into something a bit nicer looking. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
