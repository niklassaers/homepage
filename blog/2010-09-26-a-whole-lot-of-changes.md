Today I&#8217;ve done what I should have done (and in part did) a long time ago, get my blog up again, retire other blogs, integrate those posts here and modernize this blog. I did update WordPress a while back, adding a new design, but this time I&#8217;ve actually completed the look and made it, well, less fancy. It&#8217;s the content, not the design, and until I get someone to actually make a working design, a slightly customized standard-design will do well for me.

My blog had been offline for a while due to a bad combination: server formatting (I changed from running ESXi with FreeBSD on top to just FreeBSD) and laziness. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;m integrating my photoblog and early music blog, and ~10 years of blogging plus two blog integrations made for an awful lot of dead links. But the weather is awful today, so I&#8217;m in the process of fixing them up too.

Anyway, my plan is that a fresh look, having the old content up-to-date and letting it be the hub of what I do online, I&#8217;ll actually get around to write interesting stuff again, something I&#8217;ve not done on a regular basis for a while. Having it the way I want it should help for motivation. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> So, new improved blog&#8230; let&#8217;s see what comes <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
