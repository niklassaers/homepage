The speculations on Canon&#8217;s release are over, [DPReview has a preview][1] of the Canon 30D that was released today. In short: not much new from the 20D. More flexible ISO settings and a larger screen. What is this? They should&#8217;ve called it Canon 21D. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Not much of a version bump, while 10D to 20D was significant. With the release of the 5D I was hoping for some of the features to be brought down to the x0D line, but only the LCD made it. Oh well, I guess they want to keep me drooling for a 5D instead. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;ll be keeping my 20D, though. The 85mm f/1.2 lens looks cool, though. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
