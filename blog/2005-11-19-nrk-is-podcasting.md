[Norsk Rikskringskasting][1] (the Norwegian version of BBC) has long streamed its radio via the net. Now they have started with podcasting, and tell you all about it in virtually every radio program and on [this page][2]. I checked it out, and many of my favourite shows were there. Note NRK, I \*REALLY\* miss Musikk Antikk. Their page is far from structured at the moment, but as more shows are podcasted I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll introduce some structure (four almost identical news-casts, which one should I choose?)
