According to AppleInsider, Tiger is adding [  
an option to encrypt memory when its being swapped to disk][1]. If swapping wasn&#8217;t a performance drain already, this will be. Unless, of course, &#8220;encryption&#8221; is an XOR thingy or similar. (I automatically assume strong encryption <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )
