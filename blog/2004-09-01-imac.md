[Russell Beattie][1] sais it best regarding the iMac: *My toddler would knock it over*. Besdies, if this thing is going to be wall-mountable, all the wires are coming out the wrong way. And if it is not, it will look like a giant, unelegant octopus (my current imac has presently connected my stereo-system, backup-speakers, microphone, usb hub, negative film-scanner, TV breakout-box and keyboard, that&#8217;d fill all the slots in this next iMac and look rather unimpressive). It should have been simple: that one cable into the monitor should go to a little box that connects to all the cables. Break-out boxes are old news, but it works for hiding away the mess. Other oddities: No Firewire 800, slow FSB, default only 256MB RAM, still loving 80GB drives (two years ago I bought an iMac, and then the 80Gb drive that came along was small, what is this?), no DVD+RW, only DVD-R, Bluetooth not by default. I have heared nothing about WiFi, so I expect it&#8217;s there. And please don&#8217;t give me that built-in speaker &#8220;solution&#8221;.

In short: there have been many good proposals for the new iMac, this one was rather tame and has flaws that keep me from getting excited (apart from the G5 part). So my ideal solution right now would be a G5-based powerbook with an extra display.
