Now I&#8217;m sure, I&#8217;m buying a Canon 20D. I discussed the camera with the corner-photostore guy who also just ordered one, and he said an interesting thing: *don&#8217;t get the lens*. Apparently, it&#8217;s giving rounded off images. Now, I don&#8217;t have the worlds most fancy 28-80 lens on my EOS 500, but I&#8217;ve never had a problem with lenses. So, I went to look for some reviews. The lens in question is a [EF-S 18-55/3.5-5.6][1] (here reviewed by photo.net). I guess my main point is having one that I can get close enough with, as my trusty 28-80 will become a 45-128 lens. Thus 18-55 should overlap nicely, and I really shouldn&#8217;t need to go for the 17-85 lens. The conclusion from photo.net comes in the beginning of the article: *it&#8217;s good enough*. Right. I&#8217;m not an expert. If I was, I&#8217;d buy the Canon 1MkII or something. Done deal, I can&#8217;t afford the other lenses. (Interestingly, I haven&#8217;t found any packages with a 20D and a 17-85 lens)

But, just for fun, let&#8217;s take the reviews: DPReview brings us [17-18 and 10-22 lenses and a Speedlite 580EX flash][2].
