In his article on [Great Hackers][1], Paul Graham works on how productive coders actually like to work. This is a little piece I hope my current, my future and my past employers will read. While I&#8217;m sure they are heaps of exceptions, this is very much how it works for me. So if this is the kind of work I&#8217;ll be doing, do read.
