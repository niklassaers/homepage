With the release of[  
Mozilla Thunderbird 0.8][1] and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-09-14-02.html" class="broken_link">Firefox 1.0 preview</a>, the problem with [Desktop Manager][2] and [CodeTek Desktop Manager][3] are gone. For the past two release it has been beyond belief hard to input any text into Firefox and Thunderbird, to the point where I&#8217;ve gone back to Apple&#8217;s [Mail][4] and [Safari][5]. Now I can use both [Mozilla][6] products again. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
