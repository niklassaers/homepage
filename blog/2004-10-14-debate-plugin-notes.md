Blogs can be used to promote democracy. A topic can be discussed and people can leave their comments. But a plugin can be made to allow WordPress to be used for debates. This is where two or more parties discuss an issue. People should be able to leave their comments that then are a pool of &#8220;questions from the audience&#8221; that the participants are requested to answer. I think this is one of the really intersting public discussion tools that for now only are in the mainstream media and not in blogs (yet).

Do feel free to use my idea for making such a plugin or similar. I would appreciate a link back to this post, though. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
