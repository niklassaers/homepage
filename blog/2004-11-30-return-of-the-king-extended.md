A [Quicktime video][1] with a 6 minute preview of Lord of the Rings &#8211; Return of the King, the extended version, has been released. I ordered my copy from Amazon about a month ago, nice to see what I have waiting for me. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> (via <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/11/29/return-of-the-king-extended-preview/" class="broken_link">Binary Bonsai</a>)
