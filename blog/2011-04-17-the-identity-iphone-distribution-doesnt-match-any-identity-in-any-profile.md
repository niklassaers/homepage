Today was the time for my yearly developer certificate renewal. After invalidating my old certificate and making a new one, removing all old profiles, I got the error above. It took me a little while to figure it out, but while I had generated my Ad Hoc distribution profile, I hadn&#8217;t actually installed it, so I had my certificate set up for distribution but no mobile provision profile. Just my little d&#8217;oh moment, I hope it helps you figure out yours <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
