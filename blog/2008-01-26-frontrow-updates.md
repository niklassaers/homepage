One of my pet project has been FrontRow and using my mini with an Elgato Hybrid and EyeTV as a media centre. At the moment its very quirky since there isn&#8217;t much info on making FrontRow plugins, or so I thought. Yesterday I read about [PyeTV][1], an EyeTV integration for FrontRow written in Python using [FrontPython][2]. Jay! I love Python! And all this while I had been betting to read about it at [Alan&#8217;s blog][3]. But he got a girl, so jay for him as well. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;m looking forward to having some time on my hands to use FrontPython and see if I can put together a SNES launcher from FrontRow, integrated with DarwiinRemote. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Check out [Plugin101][4] for FrontPython on how to get started. Now, is anyone working on making a clone of the YouTube support that AppleTV has for FrontRow? BTW, check out [Sapphire Browser][5] that seems to have started it all
