<p>In this post abuot manual focus lenses on DSLR cameras, we&#8217;ll again look at a M42 mount and a FD mount lens. (be sure to check out the <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/2005/10/16/mf-what-is-available/">first</a> and <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/2005/11/12/manual-focus-lenses-ii/">second</a> post). The M42 mount will be my <a href="http://photos.saers.com/archives/category/manual-focus-lenses/28mm/">Miranda 28mm f/2.8</a> lens, while the FD mount lens is Mogens&#8217; <a href="http://photos.saers.com/archives/category/manual-focus-lenses/35-70mm/">35-70mm f/2.5 FD</a> lens. Again, notice that these are very fast lenses that have cost less than $40 a piece.</p>
<p>The 28mm lens has a little issue, it&#8217;s supposed to be stopped down with a lever on the mount-side of the lens that the camera will push. This needs to be jammed, or it&#8217;ll be f/2.8 all the time. I haven&#8217;t gotten around to jam it properly, so all the following pictures are at f/2.8:<br />

<p>Mogens brought his 35-70mm f/2.5 lens on a family trip to Turkey, leaving his auto-focus lenses at home. He found that it was a great companion:<br />

<p>To wet your apetite, we&#8217;ve got hold of a 2x FD-mount converter, bellows, macro rings and colour filters to toy with, and we&#8217;ll be posting photos with them as well</p>
