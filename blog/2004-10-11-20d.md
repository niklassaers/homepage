I&#8217;m not the only one to receive my Canon 20D, Michael Reichmann has an [excelent followup][1] on his last review. I agree with his comment on the shutter sound, my first reaction was *Argh!*. This will be bad in so many situations. But, the camera is so seriously great that I&#8217;ll happily live with that. Only question is: Michael, what happened when you got busted by the two? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />

My picture taken (by my mum) at Fan&#248; with the EOS 20D. Quite cropped, stored to the camera at moderate compression. Quick summary: I took ~330 photos, my battery STILL shows full power status. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

My main concern is really with my lenses.I couldn&#8217;t afford a 17-85 IS lens, so I have the 17-55mm and my trusty old 28-80mm (picture above is taken with this lens). Oh, and it&#8217;s quite heavy, which is a pro when taking the picture, but having walked around with it in my right hand the entire day, I can feel it in my shoulder. Now I have to work on my blog for a nice photoblog section as this camera sure will get addictive 

**Update:** [Randal L. Schwartz][2] loves his EOS 20D too. He talks a bit in phrases like *in an artful stroke of madness* and so on, and I need to think a bit about this as I do very much agree with many critiques of the &#8220;snapshot culture&#8221;, but I think that these critiques are usually a bit too harsh from people who get more competition. So I need to find my view on the balance. More on that later
