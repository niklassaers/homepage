This is a great incentive for communities with poor water-supply to make merry-go-rounds. [Kids run waterpumps by playing!][1] Good stuff! I&#8217;m not to certain about a <a href="http://www.rolexawards.com/laureates/laureate2.jsp?id=0023" class="broken_link">water-wheel</a>, though. I imagine it hurts backs and is incredibly uncomfortable. But then again I haven&#8217;t tried a two-digit number kilos of water on my head either. Thanks to [aWholeLotANothing][2] for pointing me to them
