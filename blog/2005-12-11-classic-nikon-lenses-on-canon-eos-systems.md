Peter Spiro wrote <a href="http://ca.geocities.com/spirope/EOSclassiclenses.htm" class="broken_link">an article</a> making the argument to use Nikkor lenses on Canon EOS cameras. It fits nicely with the manual focus argument I&#8217;ve been making. Out of special interest, he has copied a table comparing 50mm lenses. I&#8217;ve decided NOT to go for a Canon 50mm lens, even though [I&#8217;ve used my friends f/1.4 extensively][1].
