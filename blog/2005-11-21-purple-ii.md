  <p>And this concludes the Rain Dogs concert. As I'm sure you've noticed there's quite a lot of footwork in such a concert. But it was a lot of fun, the audience didn't mind me (but some actually came up to me to suggest some shots), and the band did an occational pose when they saw me. This last picture was taken with f/1.4 at 400 ISO in 1/125 second.</p>
