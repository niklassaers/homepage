The first thought was that this beer aspires to be a trapist, yet isn&#8217;t as rich in the flavour. It has a pleasant darkness (I prefer dark beer), is well balanced, nice foam and it goes well with cheese (we tried that) and chocolate. It could have a bit more notes of flower and spice, it&#8217;s easter ale after all, but I get the impression this is a beer I wouldn&#8217;t mind serving guests all year around, perhaps except for christmas. 

On a minus note, it has a faint metallic smell, but apart from that, **this is a beer I can fully recommend**, and I&#8217;ll be sure to buy a few more of. I should add that the hints of coffee were a nice plus. The label is nice, but I believe that previous years they used to have an easter bunny. In short: go bunnies! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
