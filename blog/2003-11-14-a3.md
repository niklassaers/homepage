I like unit testing, but [this guy][1] refers to [an article][2]  
that I think  
perhaps has misunderstood a little bit. Testing the internals of a  
component doesn&#8217;t give much meaning to me. Oh well, shan&#8217;t be picky,  
especially since this post was mainly to try out trackback. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
