Despite the warnings of battery drainage and poor performance, I&#8217;ve bought an iPod. After having shot 850mb worth of photos with my Canon EOS 20D, I decided to throw the 368 (yes, I shot jpeg) into the pod. Result: it took two hours and half the power of the pod is gone (the 20D still thinks its full). And the iPod is so hot that I really don&#8217;t want to put it in my pocket. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
