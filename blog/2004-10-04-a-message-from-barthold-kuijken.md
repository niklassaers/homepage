On September 20th 2004, while putting my luggage in a locker at The Hague Central Station, my shoulder bag containing four &#8211; very good &#8211; traversos (and personal papers, telephone, calendar, address book etc..) was grabbed away. It stood between my legs on the floor, but the thief was very experienced and fast: I hardly noticed a shadow moving and something slipping against my trousers.

Following instruments were stolen:

1) A. Weemaels, Hotteterre copy, 387 Hz., boxwood, in a nice wooden box it consists of 8 pieces:

*   wooden end cap
*   ivory end cap
*   head joint
*   wooden connection
*   ivory connection
*   middle joint
*   wooden foot (with ivory ring)
*   ivory foot

2) A. Weemaels, A. Grenser copy, 415 Hz., boxwood with (imitation-) ivory rings,4 pieces, no corkscrew but end cap, register foot

3) R. Tutz, I.H. Rottenburgh copy, stained boxwood with (imitation-) ivory rings, 4 pieces, corkscrew, register foot

4) Ph. Allain-Dupre (but unsigned), Quantz copy, 392 Hz., ebony or grenadilla, 4 pieces, (head joint with corkscrew and tuning slide), two keys and register on foot

The last three instruments were carried in a clear brown soft leather purse. I hope any of you could help me finding these instruments! (honestly, I don&#8217;t dare to hope very much that I&#8217;ll ever see them back, but one never knows&#8230;)

Anyway: thanks for looking out!
