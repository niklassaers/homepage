Jay, revived a project from back in April ([Lighting Matrix for Max][1]) from back when the iPhone SDK was NDA and only beta #3 was out. Well, for my first day of serious iPhone dev, I revived it, made it run with the current version, ripped out the Max/MSP part and inserted OSC instead. Good fun <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
