  <p>Mea culpa, this image should have been out LOOONG time ago! Good news is, I'm back! :-) Moved, new ISP, same couch. :-) This is from our little trip out to Kasket Karl after the Very Big Band '06 concert. Loads of interesting people who demanded their shot taken or were pushed into having their shot taken by others, but this one was by far the best. :-) Shot with f/1.4 at 1600 ISO</p>
