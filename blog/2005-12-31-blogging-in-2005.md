2005 has been quite a good year for blogging. This blog has been its regular mess of different stuff that intrests me, but it has spawned some interesting projects. [My photoblog][1], for instance, got a kick start with my photoblog entries that I used to have in this blog. Also, as I started teaching, my work related posts turned into [a blog with lecture notes][2] that my students could visit to get all the material I had to offer them. And quite recently the early music section, with quite a bit of help from some friends, is made into the <a href="http://earlymusicblog.net" class="broken_link">early music blog</a>. The [server and familly blog][3] that I set up for my father has been mostly left untouched, but all in all I&#8217;m quite content with the stuff that is being served. I&#8217;m a bit surprised by how little comments come in as my feeds have a steady amount of subscribers. Many people actually send me emails rather than leave comments, so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t get feedback, but you don&#8217;t get to read it. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Oh well, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll understand more of why this is in the following year.
