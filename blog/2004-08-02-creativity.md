A *for the geeks* variant on *how to be creative* is available at [GapingVoid][1]. I must admit disagree with his way of thinking, but by the sound of it, he&#8217;s trying to make people think big and beyond. I&#8217;d prefer introducing people to the subtleties. But I&#8217;m no teacher, so when I find that someone has done this, I&#8217;ll link to him. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
