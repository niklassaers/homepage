We already know that [Mattheson disliked French singers][1], but he doesn&#8217;t spare the British either. Quoting chapter 9 in *Der Vollkommene Capellmeister* paragraph 13-14: `...Germans generally produce more basses and tenors but the Italians more altos and sopranos than all other regions: together with the more rugged climate and lifestyle also beer drinking contributes to this in the case of the Germans; but the Italians are the opposite in both respects, and in addition there is the frequent castration.`

 `Thus it is also certain that for example in England there are not by a long shot as many well-trained voices, and in France everyone sings mroe out of the throat and not from the chest as in Italy, where the voices are more sonorous, clear, pure and expansive`
