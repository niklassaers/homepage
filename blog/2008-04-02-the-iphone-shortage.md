The mac world is high on expectations because of what is [apparently a shortage of iPhones][1]. New version coming up soon? Yes, probably. People hope for a 3G version. I hope for one too. I expect it to be announced in June and available end August. People think of a 32gb version. Sounds logical. But didn&#8217;t people notice Intel&#8217;s announcement of their Atom processor? Here&#8217;s [ZDNet&#8217;s take on it][2]. I would expect this to mean that an iPhone based on this architecture would be launched, perhaps silently even. Just a bit more horse power, very fitting for iPhone OS 2.0. Perhaps with a 32gb option. But still EDGE, no 3G. Then a 32gb version with 3G could be announced in June and become widely available in august.
