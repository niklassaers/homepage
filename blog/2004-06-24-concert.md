I went to a concert at [Norges Musikkh√∏gskole][1] and heared Ingeborg Dalheim&#8217;s exam concert. This was really the best singing I&#8217;ve heared in quite a while, and I&#8217;m hoping to hear more of her later on. It was a well-composed exam with exciting music, and I by far preferred her Rameau piece that sounded magnificent, but Monteverdi was really good and the Vivaldi pieces were splendid. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> I don&#8217;t know to much of Norwegian folk music (I&#8217;d really like to get to know more, though), but what I heared sounded good, as did the modern work. If you have the chance I&#8217;d totally recommend hearing a concert with her.
