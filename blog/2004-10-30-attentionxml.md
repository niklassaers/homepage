From Technorati:

*   How many sources of information must you keep up with?
*   Tired of clicking the same link from a dozen different blogs?
*   RSS readers collect updates, but with so many unread items, how do you know which to read first?

[Attention.XML][1] is designed to to solve these problems and enable a whole new class of blog and feed related applications.

Good stuff, guys, I&#8217;m excited to hear about it and wonder where this&#8217;ll go. (via [Jeremy Zawodny][2])
