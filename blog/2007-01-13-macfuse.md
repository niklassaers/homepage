Thank you Google, they have released [MacFuse][1]. (<a href="http://bsdnews.com/view_story.php3?story_id=6160" class="broken_link">tip from BSD News</a>) I love [FUSE][2] with FreeBSD, but since I usually use FreeBSD for my servers and would like to use FUSE on my workstation, this is great! See Google&#8217;s <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/01/macfuse-fuse-for-mac-os-x.html" class="broken_link">blog entry</a> about it. As I write I&#8217;ve got a couple of [SSHFS][3] mounts up. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> For my work, I&#8217;m really looking forward to use something like <a href="http://dev.extensibleforge.net/wiki/s3/fuse" class="broken_link">S3FS</a> with [Amazon&#8217;s S3][4]. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
