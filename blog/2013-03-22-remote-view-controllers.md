Dear iOS dev,  
if you haven&#8217;t already read Ole Begemann&#8217;s article on [Remote View Controllers][1] (and [part 2][2] and [part 3][3]), you should do so now. I think and hope this will be one of those bread-and-butter features of iOS 7, so now would be a great time to think of where XPC and remote views fit into your existing and upcoming apps.
