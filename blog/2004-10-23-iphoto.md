Is it just me, or is iPhoto getting seriously old. First off all, it doesn&#8217;t support RAW yet, so the CR2 files from my Canon EOS 20D are easily getting seriously disorganized. Seconldy, speed&#8230; sorry Apple, I&#8217;ve seen iPhoto 4 with 7000 1 mb pictures with the odd 40mb picture in it, it&#8217;s just not up to par on your iMac 1Ghz/1GB which should be more than good enough to handle this. How hard is it to cache those thumbnails? Waiting minutes every time you move the scrollbar just doesn&#8217;t work. So I&#8217;ve stuck with iPhoto 2 which is equally slow. Features of iPhoto 4 I&#8217;d like of course, and I&#8217;m so looking forward to hearing news of what Apple has in plan for the next revision (will that be iPhoto 6, 8 or 16, btw? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) as iPhoto 2 doesn&#8217;t work well for more than a gb of photos at a time or so.
