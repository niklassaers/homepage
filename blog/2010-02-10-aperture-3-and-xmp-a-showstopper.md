It seems that Apple doesn&#8217;t want people switching from Lightroom to Aperture. In [this support document][1], Apple confirms that they only import strictly what they HAVE to to say that they comply with XMP, but they don&#8217;t support XMP enough to make it useful. Expect to loose all your labels and ratings when importing from Lightroom, and don&#8217;t expect to have the data transfer back to Lightroom in case Adobe releases Lightroom 3 and you&#8217;d rather stick with that after your 30 trial days are up.

If you&#8217;ve run in to XMP issues with Aperture 3, do feel free to leave a comment.
