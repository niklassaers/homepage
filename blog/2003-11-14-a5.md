A couple of jar-files look like being in conflict. Strange, as I have  
no idea why someone would dist java.util-jars. Anyways, got that  
cleaned up and our main apps are purring nicely again.

The templates for our statistics aren&#8217;t applied correctly. I imagine  
there are some path conflicts there. Applied some logging yesterday,  
time to investigate&#8230;. hmm&#8230; classpath is incorrect. Fixed. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Now for fixing file permissions when generating new users&#8230;.
