I bought a [3 EazyInternet][1] mobile broadband modem and subscription this week, thinking it would be sweet with 7,2Mbit on the go. And it works fine, cool thing having on my mac. But, alas, when installing it, the installer disabled my Airport WLAN and wired Ethernet interfaces, so currently I&#8217;m locked to using \*ONLY\* 3 network, which is \*REALLY\* slow compared to the wired network at work and the WLAN at home.
