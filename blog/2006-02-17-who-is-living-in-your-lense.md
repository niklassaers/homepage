*Therefore, the owner of the lens did not have any idea that there was someone living inside the lens*. I found this quote when searching on how to clean lens fungus. Not that I have found any on my lenses, but a very interesting lense just turned up but with some fungus. Read more on [lens fungi][1] and how to remove them.
