According to The Seattle Times, [coffee really is addictive][1]. In other words: no news today. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

What is really funny is they find that an average american drinks 3.4 cups of coffee a day. Now, how much is a cup? Is a cup the same amount of coffee as an espresso shot? My cup of coffee is typically three espressos that fit nicely in a cup. There&#8217;s even room for hot water, hot cream, cinamon, liquer, whatever you desire for your coffee (yes, cookies and chocolate too). Is this regarded as a cup? An americano is typically an espresso with buckets of warm water, producing the worlds probably thinnes coffee. Do americans drink americano&#8217;s? (looks like they do in Friends, but then again how american are the Friends characters? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )
