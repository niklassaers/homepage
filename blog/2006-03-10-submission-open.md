A short little update: now you can use the submit story/recording/photo buttons in the righthand sidebar to submit the material you&#8217;d like included on the blog. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> No need to register and create the blog entries yourself anymore.

Sorry about the long delay before writing. I am in the middle of moving to a new apartment and spend my days building and painting walls. But, Mogens&#8217; harpsichord is well in place, Craig has sent me one of his <a href="http://www.saers.com/~craig/SuperRecorder.html" class="broken_link">Carmichael&#8217;s Modern Baroque Recorder</a> that I&#8217;ll be trying out as soon as I&#8217;ve finished moving. Also, we have some music in store for you to listen to and some pictures coming up. So stay tuned.
