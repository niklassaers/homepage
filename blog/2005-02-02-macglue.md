Merging two old photo libraries (one that constantly made iPhoto crash that worked well when upgraded to iPhoto 5 with other old ones that I used to make iPhoto 2 quicker) I came across [Cleaning iPhoto][1] and Mac::Glue. So a quick:

`<br />
perl -MCPAN -e 'install "Mac::Glue"'<br />
gluemac /Applications/iPhoto.app<br />
`

and off I was using his scripts to compare MD5 hashes. I&#8217;ll be using Mac::Glue to do the same cleaning up for iTunes where my duplicate count is getting higher quickly.

And in case you&#8217;re one of my friends who know I don&#8217;t like perl, I still don&#8217;t. But the alternative was AppleScript
