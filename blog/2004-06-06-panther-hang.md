My Mac locked up! While this may not be surprising, it&#8217;s worth noting as my Mac virtually never hangs. Had the look and feel of a filesystem hang. The userinterface updated nicely, all network ports accepted connections, but the windowsmanager wouldn&#8217;t respond to any clicks, just moving the mouse and the ports never presented anything much, and it all happened upon multiple known writes. Anyways, only lost data is a save of a mail that had been sent before the hang. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
