It is a bit darker than a classic, cloudy with a nice white foam. The first taste is of spice and flowers, but not heavy at all. Very fitting for spring and easter.

This beer works probably best with food. I was drinking it slowly, and while it&#8217;s getting warmer it looses its gas fairly quickly, so while this is no problem with many easter ales, you should probably drink this one fairly quick.
