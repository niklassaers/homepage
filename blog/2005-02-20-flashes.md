Me and Mogens were looking at wide-angle lenses, which of course brings me on to the subject of flashes. What I&#8217;ve really wanted to play with is several flashes, for instance a Canon 580ex and two Canon 420ex&#8217;es as slaves. But since Canon hasn&#8217;t decided to sponsor my blog with these lenses just yet, I started reading up on alternatives. 

My first suprise was, the wireless support for these lenses is infra-red. Hello, radio has been around for a loooong time! Do you think I&#8217;ll have those extra flashes put in a place where they can have &#8220;eye-contact&#8221;? So, looks like I&#8217;ll be waiting for a new series of flashes. 

But, I found it interesting that the Sigma EF-500 DG works just like the 580ex, people have been really pleased about it and it&#8217;s just half the price of the Canon. Alas, the Sigma seems to get a thumbs down from [one wedding photographer (Ben Rubenstein)][1]. (the other reviews were good, but way shorter) The EF-500 was Sigma&#8217;s answer to Canon&#8217;s 550ex, guess we&#8217;ll see what they&#8217;ll match the 580ex with. While we&#8217;re waiting, read the [EF-500 review][2] and the [580ex review][3]. 

New to flash photography with Canon camera&#8217;s? Read [this introduction][4]. It&#8217;s a bit long, but it has all that you want 

Well, to summarize the lens issue: I might be selling my [EF-S 18-55mm][5] and only use my EF 28-80mm and use 0.42x fisheye lens I [was conned][6] into buying. Or, I&#8217;ll continue, as now, to use my 18-55mm for fisheye only. The options we read up on were [EF-S 10-22mm][7] [(samples)][8]/[(forum reviews)][9] that would suit me very well (that is, if I started doing landscape photography and such. Right now, my use for this lens would probably be quite limited), but the [EF 17-40mm][10] has got really good critiques in different forums as well, even though the 10-22mm forum sais to stay away from the 17-40mm if the 10-22mm is an option. My main critique of the 10-22mm is that 10mm looks very fish-eye&#8217;ish. For fisheye, I think the [Peleng 9mm][11] featured on [Chromasia][12] seems spectacular. But for now I&#8217;ll keep toying with my EF-S 18-55mm and the 0.42x fisheye.
