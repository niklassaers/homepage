I&#8217;m working on a couple of updates for Well Tempered, both for adding more temperaments and for refining the UI after a couple of users have been so kind as to provide useful suggestions. That&#8217;s great, I love that kind of feedback! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> What&#8217;s not so good is that Well Tempered is now being distributed outside the AppStore, without my consent. I&#8217;d love some feedback on how to handle such trials. I really hope people getting it through those channels consider upgrading to the retail version as there have been some important improvements since the initial release.
