It&#8217;s great seeing that <a href="http://www.playframework.org/2.0" class="broken_link">Play 2.0</a> is <a href="https://github.com/playframework/play20" class="broken_link">on its way</a>. Play is my favorite Scala playground, but it&#8217;s always felt like a second class citizen there. With 2.0, it&#8217;s a first class Citizen, and they&#8217;ve even thrown [Akka][1] into the mix. So, as with anything I&#8217;m especially interested in, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://play.lighthouseapp.com/users/28377" class="broken_link">signed up</a> to submit <a href="https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/74274/tickets/52-play20-todolist-scala-scalaquery-sample-has-exception#ticket-52-1" class="broken_link">two</a> <a href="https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/74274/tickets/53-play20-kiki-sample-error#ticket-53-1" class="broken_link">bugreports</a>.
