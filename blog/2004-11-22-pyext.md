Thought you&#8217;d might want to see just how simple it is: <a href="http://niklas.saers.com/blog/wp-content/pyExt.tgz" title="pyext example for Pure Data" class="broken_link">my pyext example for Pure Data</a>. I&#8217;m planning to make an object that takes in a floating point number of frequency height and determines what note it is and the amount of error according to different scale temperaments, i.e. Valotti, Werkmeister 3, Kirnberger, Meantone and Equal tempering.
