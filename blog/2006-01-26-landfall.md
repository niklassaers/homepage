  <p>The last of my duck shots. :-) I waited for these ducks to come to shore and shot a single shot getting this one. :-) Goes to show that shooting big salves doesn't really help much, I don't believe I would have got this one with a high burstrate. Shot in 1/250 seconds at f/5.0 with 400 ISO and 75mm</p>
