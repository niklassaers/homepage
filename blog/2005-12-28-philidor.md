  <p>A gorgeous Dieter/Nikolaj (a.k.a. Morgan Workshop) Bressan 415 Voiceflute with Pierre Philidor's 10th suite that I'm playing together with Mogens. These gorgeous instruments sound great, and I enjoy playing them imensley. :-) Shot at f/8.0 in 1/50 second with 1600 ISO and a 75mm focal length</p>
