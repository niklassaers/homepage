[Macrumors reports][1] that AppleTV Take Two includes airtunes support! Yay! Finally some light in this dark tunnel. And here I was thinking that Apple had abandoned the technology after leaving it out of new Airports. I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing just what it will do. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Stream? Play back? Both ways? Bridge?
