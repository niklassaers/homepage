  <p>This image is from this mid-summer when I was out with members from <a href="http://odu.meg.nu/">Oslo Domkirkes Ungdomskor</a> at a cozy outdoor pub. This is our conductor. It's taken at ISO 800 in 1/100 second with a f/2.8 aperture. It was set to shutter priority and the -1 stop exposure bias has been corrected for during post-prosessing. Unfortunately, <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/2005/10/10/open-source-noise-reduction/">there isn't much open source noise reduction software available</a> and since I was at home I haven't been able to use any. Sorry about that.</p>
