Nothing much new with todays roast, it&#8217;s the same as two days ago, but with 45 seconds less in the last stage. My reason for this was that I found that roast to be just a little bit too burnt in smell, and I want to see what implications that has for taste. Also, these beans were directly up from the freezer, so the change for them must have been very drastic.

Regarding grinding, I&#8217;ve found this advice: <quote>The grind should be just slightly finer than sugar. Kinda sandy but you can smoosh it together with your fingers.</quote> However, doing this I get no crema. Using Lavazza or Illy (which are about grinded to about sugar size) I got no crema. Using supermarket beans I get little crema. Using fresh roasted beans I get crema, but just a couple of millimeters, not the excess of crema as seen on many videos and reported by other Pavoni users.

In other news I&#8217;m looking at tampers. It seems that there&#8217;s more to it than I thought. The La Pavoni Pro I have should probably have a 51mm tamper, but now I&#8217;ve found that they make them both flat and convex. So many choices&#8230;.

Oh, btw, [Coffee Geek][1] has a nice iRoast 2 [review][2] released two days ago

. Also I found a nice [La Pavoni Introduction][3].
