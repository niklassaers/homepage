I got an email today from two of my friends who had sent an email to everyone notifying that their email had changed. Not willing to do this work every time someone changes something I thought, I can just grab this via Facebook. A while back I used Address Book Sync (http://danauclair.com/addressbooksync/) and that was great, but one day it stopped working. I checked it out again, and although the new version 1.4 locks up while syncing, it actually does some work while appearing locked, and after a while it had chewed through my friends list and was ready to update my friends. It categorized them in matched and unmatched, so I started by syncing everyone who was matched. That seemed fine, but it synced photos more than phone numbers and email addresses, which is what I&#8217;m after. A couple of tests revealed that I was missing emails, adresses, phone numbers and homepages. Hmm&#8230; not quite there yet. What do you use? What do you recommend?
