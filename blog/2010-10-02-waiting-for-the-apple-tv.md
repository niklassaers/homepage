The new AppleTV with iOS inside has me very excited as a developer and a media consumer. But, unfortunately, after the new AppleTV was announced, the old Apple TV is still on sale here in <a title="Danish Apple Store" href="http://store.apple.com/dk/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/appletv" class="broken_link">Denmark</a>, <a title="Norwegian Apple Store" href="http://store.apple.com/no/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/appletv" class="broken_link">Norway</a> and <a title="Swedish Apple Store" href="http://store.apple.com/se/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/appletv" class="broken_link">Sweden</a>. What gives, Apple? You neglect the most technophile part of Europe, both with the iPad and now with the AppleTV, without an obvious reason. I emailed support a few weeks ago, and they asked me to check back when the AppleTV started shipping. So now I guess we&#8217;ll have to drive to Germany to pick one up, just like with the iPad. Lucky for me that&#8217;s easier than for the Norwegians.
