Welcome to the Early Music Blog. This project was started by [Niklas Saers][1] after discussing it with a couple of friends and will hopefully be a place where people interested in early music will post their thoughts and stories and link up other early music blogs. I hope that you will find this site interesting and participate throught commenting and posting your thoughts and ideas.

If you&#8217;d like to write for Early Music Blog, please register and I&#8217;ll be sure to give you writing priveleges
