There is a great [VSTi][1] host for free available for mac at [reFuse Software][2]. It&#8217;s ugly and it does the job great! And it&#8217;s free. So I&#8217;ve finally been able to test the VSTi I made with Max/MSP and it works like a charm. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
