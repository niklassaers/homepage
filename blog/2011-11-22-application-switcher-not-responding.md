From time to time I get the same problem: the application switcher (command-tab) stops responding. It usually takes closing a lot of programs or restarting to get it working again. Today, I seem to have found the gangster: Screen Sharing. When I closed it, application switching started working again. It must have taken over the control over a couple of keys too many.
