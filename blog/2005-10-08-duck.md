  <p>This is the first picture I put up here taken with <a href="http://blog.saers.com/archives/2005/08/10/lenses-arrived/">my Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8</a> lens. It's f/2.8 at 75mm with a 2x converter. The 2x converter really takes a lot of the image, so no wonder that Tamron advices against it in their manual. </p>
