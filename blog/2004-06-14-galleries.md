Seems everyone is making galleries for inclusion with WordPress these days. Pictorials is coming up with release two. Checked out PhotoStack, but was too much work to be done by myself, not much for integrating existing templates with a quick-and-dirty-tag. Have heared nothing back from the iPAP guy (what&#8217;s in a name? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) Everything&#8217;s in beta&#8230;
