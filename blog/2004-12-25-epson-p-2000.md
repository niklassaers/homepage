According to [DPReview][1]: the P-2000 is a very well-designed, very sophisticated and very desirable addition to any serious digital photographer&#8217;s gadget bag. My conclusion from reading [their review][2]: drool <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Good luck to Epson with the RAW support. My 20D is already supported, but it seems they have just a little further to go.

Oh, and merry christmas to everyone coming by my blog <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
