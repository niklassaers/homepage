I was installing a set of templates on a sharepoint server I&#8217;m setting up for work, and I came accross [these great instruction][1] on how to install them, since I had the same problem as Matthew in the comments. I even learned that the command line has for-loops. I always assumed this shell had absolutely nothing. Now I just believe it&#8217;s very limited. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> zsh for Windows? (without Cygwin?)
