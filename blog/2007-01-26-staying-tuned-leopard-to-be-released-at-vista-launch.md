Apple launches draws press. If Apple were to release something spectacular at the same time, that would draw a lot of press, downplaying the Vista release. Leopard will be spectacular, and so will iLife &#8217;07 and iWork &#8217;07 based on Leopard. To me it would make perfect sense for Apple to release all these three packages at the Vista launch date. I would love it even more if they released it all as one product. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> They asked us to stay tuned, I&#8217;m on my fourth double espresso and shivering with tention! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
