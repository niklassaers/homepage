  <p>Taken at 1600 ISO in 1/8 second. Kids on holiday tend to run about and never stand still. Being new to this manual-lens-universe I had to play with my nephew all day to make him tired and take photos in the evening (which actually didn't make the job any easyer). Here on the balkony at our hotel</p>
