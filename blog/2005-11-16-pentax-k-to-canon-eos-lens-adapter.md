As I mentioned in [my first MF lens post][1], Bob has a great [article][2] on manual focus lenses for the Canon EOS. He writes *it turns out that the diaphragm coupling lever which sticks out from the back of the lens makes *[adapting Pentax K lenses on a Canon EOS body]* impossible*. This is the standard answer you will get, and at the moment I cannot find any adapters on eBay or any other retailer. Lucky for us Michael Pollet has put this claim to shame. In [his article][3] he writes a detailed instruction of how to adapt a M42->EOS adapter to the Pentax K lenses instead. I was planning on doing something similar but haven&#8217;t received my Pentax K lenses yet so I haven&#8217;t been able to tell if its feasable. Luckily he&#8217;s shown that if at loss, this is a great way to go. He reaches infintity focussing and has done some quite interesting modification. If you&#8217;d like to mass-produce such an adapter he even offers to send you a prototype for inspection. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long until we can see such product on eBay. Until then we&#8217;ll all get our old metal working equipment out.
