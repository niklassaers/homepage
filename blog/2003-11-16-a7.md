Trying out all these blog-programs turns out to be quite an experience.  
And, I&#8217;m learning heaps of how lots of people prefer writing their java  
programs. My todo-list is growing by the minute.

So, just to see what  
this progam was like I fired up Windows and installed w.bloggar. My  
main objection to w.bloggar and every other client I&#8217;ve used so far is  
that they don&#8217;t really support images well. I do &#8220;insert image&#8221; and  
they expect me to give an URL. Well, in most cases I&#8217;ve probably have  
the image on my Canon Ixus or my mobile phone. I expect to have to  
download the images to my computer, but from there I&#8217;d like to just  
stick it in my post, letting the client and my blog server handle the  
uploading between them.

Secondly, I&#8217;m looking forwards to plugins. My picture gallery is a  
hack. I&#8217;m going to have a better stab at it, but it&#8217;ll include my  
Apache-server, so it won&#8217;t be all within the webapp domain. I&#8217;d prefer  
it to be so, because you cannot really expect long-time consistency  
having o juggle a blog on two or three servers. And although I use PHP  
and Python heaps, I don&#8217;t really feel like mixing them in.

Further more, I really need to get rid of this URL if I&#8217;m going to  
substitute my homepage for a blog.

A last notice, posting this through w.bloggar removed all the newlines  
thus making my entire posting unreadable. When I pressed edit in  
roller, the title showed up but the contents didn&#8217;t. In short, this  
sucks, there are clearly problems between the two (Roller is probably  
at least as much to blame), but hey, that saves me starting up Windows

PS, when give me plugins&#8230; although so-called emoticons are plain  
stupid, I wouldn&#8217;t mind a plugin converting the ones I write until some  
that look good
