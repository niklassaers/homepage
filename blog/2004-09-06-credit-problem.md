Dear all, I&#8217;m having a problem giving correct credit to the blogs where I find links with interesting content. Each day I read my newsfeed of ~160 feeds. While reading it, I spawn 30 or so background tabs, and if I find something I really want to blog about, I blog about it. Finding BACK to what entry I clicked from takes much time this way, and thus it&#8217;s all to easy to give less credit than what I&#8217;d like to. So, I was wondering if you have any suggestions for SIMPLE solutions that would allow a user to know where the page he&#8217;s coming from originates from?
