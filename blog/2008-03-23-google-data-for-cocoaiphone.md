According to iPhone Atlas, [Google has pushed out a new release of its GData Objective-C Client Library][1] that can be used with the iPhone SDK. Yay for Google! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> [Check it out][2]! For my last job I used Google Spreadsheets and Google Documents quite a bit, and it&#8217;s great being able to integrate it. Making a little word processor with synchronization to GDocs should be fairly trivial now. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
