A couple of hours ago my blog was spammed with lots of comments. They all got caught, so no worries, but what surprised me was that although they were clearly spamming for the same host, they came almost all from differen IP-adresses, radically different IP-adresses: 12.22.85.3  
193.145.88.17, 193.165.223.2, 200.35.83.27  
200.56.233.5, 202.125.129.138, 203.150.28.215, 203.169.115.134, 203.246.165.35, 206.163.199.1, 210.3.7.150, 210.4.143.254, 210.5.71.243, 212.47.27.186, 213.253.212.101, 61.19.243.11, 63.81.122.87, 64.19.80.100, 64.3.231.3, 65.112.88.98, 66.178.7.6, 66.192.31.98, 67.136.50.93, 80.53.138.10, 80.55.131.150, 80.58.20.235, 80.58.46.235, 80.84.154.70, 81.118.4.4.  
Someone is having a bit more fun with distributed computing than they should.
