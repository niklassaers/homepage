*She cradled him to her chest, she looked into her boy&#8217;s eyes, she stroked his face and she snapped his neck.* This is The Observer writing on [systematic rape in Kosovo][1] where 4.4% of the female population were systematically raped during the Balkan war. This article is long and horrible in detail, is about the consequences and what was hushed down, and should definetly be read.
