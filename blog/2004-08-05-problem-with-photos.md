According to <a href="http://www.news8austin.com/content/headlines/Default.asp?ArID=79653&SecID=2" class="broken_link">an US news site</a> *&#8220;You know the bands &#8212; their names, their music, their image &#8212; everything is licensed. And if somebody takes a photograph of the band, and that picture ends up on e-bay and somebody&#8217;s paying money for it, the band&#8217;s not seeing any of that revenue, then they have a problem with it,&#8221; Barry Kohlus, with The Backyard, said.* So let me get this right, if I take a picture of something and sell it, what&#8217;s in the picture should get money for it? If I take a picture of the Eiffel tower, should I pay some Paris agency for that? If I take a picture of someone, should I pay them for it? Hmm&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been in the newspapers a couple of times, twice on TV and in various sites. Does that mean that all these places should pay me for the picture? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Obviously, someone must have their licencing wrong. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
