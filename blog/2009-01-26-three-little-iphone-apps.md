Good fun: today I submitted three little iPhone apps for review, hopefully they&#8217;ll be up in the AppStore within long. The first is [Well Tempered][1], my tuning application, that&#8217;ll be for sale. It&#8217;s for tuning early music instruments such as harpsichords and organs and will have many early music temperaments. Do see [the product page][1]. Then there are [pOSCa and OSCar][2], free OSC controllers that&#8217;ll get electronic musicians up from their chairs and performing. Can&#8217;t wait to have them online and I wonder what people will think of them. I like them very much. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Updates will of course be provided as necessary.
