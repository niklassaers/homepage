If you didn&#8217;t notice Tao of Mac&#8217;s post, [go read it][1]. Your /var/log/windowserver.log on your Tiger system may be updated every time you press a key. Mine certainly was. Good thing [there is a solution][2], although it should have been patched by Apple long time ago. Buggar that. Oh well, patched manually.
