Everyone and their grandma seems to blog about [Google Notebook][1] that was launched today. They support Windows and Linux officially, but the Firefox plugin worked great with OS X 10.4 at home as well, so Mac users aren&#8217;t left behind. Now I&#8217;m looking forward to all those &#8220;Note This!&#8221; plugins for WordPress that are sure to come within the next few days. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
