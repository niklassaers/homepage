[Firefox][1] 0.9 for OS X wasn&#8217;t much better. I can&#8217;t type in the adress bar. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I don&#8217;t think [Mozilla][2] has too extensive tests for OS X. I&#8217;m looking forward to a rapid re-release or something. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
