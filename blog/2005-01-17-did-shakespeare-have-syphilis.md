<a href="http://www.idsociety.org/Template.cfm?Section=News_from_the_Journals&CONTENTID=11392&TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm" class="broken_link">to</a> wonder if Shakespeare had syphilis. He may have been given bath treatments to kill the bacteria and have had to inhale quicksilver to &#8220;cure&#8221; him and may have died from the treatment, which caused him to loose hair, shiver and become asocial. Or, people may be exagerating. You read the evidence and figure it out.
