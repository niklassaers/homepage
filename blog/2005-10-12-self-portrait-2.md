  <p>This picture is taken with my 37mm f/2.8 MIR-1 M42 mount lens without filters at ISO 400 in 1/50 second. I was reminded to take self-portraits when looking through my books, so this was my task for this image and the next. Both are from the same room at Vestjysk Musikkonservatorium in Esbjerg</p>
