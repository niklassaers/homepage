Wow, I remember back in 1998, me and another photo enthusiast were discussing DSLRs vs digital film. I was holding out on DSLRs until there was a camera that could fit my lenses and was as good as the Canon 500N I had at the time. Turned out I&#8217;d be waiting a while, the first one I got (matched the requirements!) was the Canon 20D. Anyway, my friend showed a links on Slashdot and a few papers on &#8220;Digital Film&#8221;, and I had to agree: that was probably a much better fit for the time.

Well, digital film didn&#8217;t materialize, until now (or rather, soon) hopefully: [Tom&#8217;s guide has an article][1] where they describe Park Hyun Jin&#8217;s concept:

While in my mind the right time was 1998 and the wrong time is 2011, I would still love a &#8220;roll&#8221; for my analogue camera, and I might even get a few more old systems for the pure joy of using them <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
