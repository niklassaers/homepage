I haven&#8217;t figured out what all the fuzz about Dahsboard is. I gave Konfabulator a shot once. Looks nice when you&#8217;re using it, it&#8217;s good for server monitoring etc. Sorry for the Konfabulator guy that Apple made a smiliar product. I hope he at least had a chance to strike a deal similar to what the guys who made Panther&#8217;s filebrowser got. Anyways, Konfabulator had a problem, and Dashboard has the same. An Apple-blogger sais it right out: <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005876" class="broken_link"><br /> Dashboard is (from a browser geek&#8217;s perspective): HTML sidebar panels liberated from the browser window and placed anywhere on the screen</a>. Meaning, using it gives you nothing but clutter on your desktop. Big deal? Probably not, but you&#8217;re not going to get good information here as you&#8217;re training yourself to ignore it. Worse yet, when the Konfabulator widgets fail, they often more or less stall, making the ready-at-hand/present-at-hand discussion relevant again: it will jump up at you and annoy you when it fails. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s failed when I&#8217;m not reading the information, and because I&#8217;ll be trained to ignore it, it&#8217;ll be nothing but a hassle. When I get 10.4, I&#8217;ll be sure to turn it off straight away, just like I never wanted to use Konfabulator much.
