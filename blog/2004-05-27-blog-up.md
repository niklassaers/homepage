I needed to post this somewhere, so I made a blog. Home blog. Hooray&#8230; better than my old html-page with weblog-like-contents. Anyways, reason I couldn&#8217;t use my old roller blog was that I needed a TrackBack. But hey, the blog I wanted to refer has no trackback-support either. Argh! 5 minutes wasted. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Anyways, [this Apple-blog][1] told me version 10.3.4 of OS X is out. Good stuff. It&#8217;s just general blah-blah, but this is what I&#8217;m hoping for:  
*improved disc burning and recording functionality*, DVD+R(W) coming? My drive is really a DVD+/-RW but is locked to DVD-R only. Way to go Apple. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  
*additional FireWire audio and USB device compatibility*, can I now finally hook up my Nomad Jukebox 3? I was happy when I read Apple supported it with iTunes, only to find out that they only supported version 1.0. Now I&#8217;m hoping. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> (update installing)
