I need Adium for Social Networks. Adium is an IM tool that has &#8216;em all and runs nicely under OS X. Social Networks are exploding. So I thought it would be fun to look for some of my friends, but after trying to find a few it hit me: there are so many networks. I would have to search each one of them. And what if they join tomorrow? I&#8217;d have to search again unless they search for me. I have an account at Orkut, Facebook, Blink and probably quite a few others. I usually don&#8217;t log in to them. So I would need something that searches for my friends in all of them when I search, and which could do that over again whenever I wish to check if they&#8217;ve showed up. Then I&#8217;d probably need some interface to keep my information on all of them up-to-date, and to be able to manage them one way or another. Any ideas for an Adium-like client for social networks?
