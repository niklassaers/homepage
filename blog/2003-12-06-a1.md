Right, if you&#8217;ve been following my blog you might have been a little discouraged getting the 500 HTTP-error for about a month. Well, short story shorter: I wrote a velocity macro that had an error that brought Roller down. Removing the macro hard from the db didn&#8217;t work, so it wasn&#8217;t until today I could be bothered starting it from scratch. Oh well&#8230; I might put back a bit of the old content. We&#8217;ll see&#8230; <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Apart from that, this is December 6th, my name day and St. Niklas (Sinterklaas). Had an amazing breakfast with my dear neighbour and now I&#8217;ll shower, go practise and then go grocery-shopping. The weather is fantastic today.

Oh, and yesterday Dag-Erling submitted a request for me to become a FreeBSD doc-committer. (you have read [my thesis][1] on FreeBSD, right?) This was after we finally returned to integrating parts of my thesis with the FreeBSD documentation ([draft available here][2]) and quite much will need updating
