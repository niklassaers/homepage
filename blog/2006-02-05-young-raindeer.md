  <p>This was one of the last deer we met after having visited some incredibly shy deer. This one was young and tried to look couragous although he seemed a littlebit unsure about what was really going on. I was going full on my memory card, so while the rest have been shot in RAW, this one was shot JPEG at f/3.2 in 1/60 seconds with  400 ISO at 48mm</p>
