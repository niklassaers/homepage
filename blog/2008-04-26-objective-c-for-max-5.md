I bought my upgrade of Max 5 yesterday, and I&#8217;m of course eagerly waiting for my license code. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Trying to put Objective-C and Cocoa into all that I do, I found [RÃ©my Muller&#8217;s blogpost][1] about writing Objective-C externals for Max. Also, [Electrotap]() has posted [ObjectiveMax][2] on Google Code. It&#8217;s dual-licensed GPL/Commercial which of course make BSD licensed code and closed-source-but-free a non-option. I&#8217;ll probably try out both and port much of my Java stuff over to have it working at greater speed and tested with Max 5

On the same page, RÃ©my writes about Bonjour for Max/MSP, and with my iPhone development efforts such as [Lighting Matrix][3] I&#8217;m planning on implementing a Bonjour interface as an option to UDP. (I&#8217;d also like to try out bluetooth just like the Wii interface [aka.wiiremote][4], but that&#8217;s not a near-future plan as I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s supported through the official SDK yet)
