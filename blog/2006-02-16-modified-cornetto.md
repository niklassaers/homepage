Wanting to get a different sound from my cornetto, an oboe playing friend of mine and I mounted a reed instead of the regular mouth piece on it. I wanted more of a <a href="http://www.recorderhomepage.net/crumhorn.html" class="broken_link">crumhorn</a> sound but ended up with something that sounded fantastic on every 20th try and otherwise was really hard to play. Lots of strange sounds coming as well. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> But I like the idea. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Here are the photos. First the reed, then two full-length versions of my Moeck cornetto with the reed and finally the normal mouthpiece.
