I&#8217;ve used many version control systems, but this week has been the first time I&#8217;ve used Mercurial for anything more than a bit of testing. It looks good to me, so I read a bit around to see how people are using it in their projects, and I came accross Lajos Kamocsay&#8217;s post about [how he includes Mercurials branch and revision information in his Xcode projects][1] that I think deserves a shout-out.
