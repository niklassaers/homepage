Tuesday&#8217;s Apple announcement held many goodies, but Apple seems to be going nowhere on Airtunes. Airport Extreme had been updated, but no Audio Out. And with my Airport Express, I cannot simply add more Airport Expresses to play the same set of music in every room of my house: *Because iTunes and the Express use Apple Lossless compression to encode music (rather than native MP3 or AAC), you can stream audio to only one unit at a time* ([source][1]). Dear Apple, wouldn&#8217;t you make a nice little plug-this-adapter-in-the-wall-and-get-audio-out Airtunes device that I can put in every room of my house with a stereo, and throw in a remote control or two in the package?
