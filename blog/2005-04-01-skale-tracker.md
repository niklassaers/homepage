[Skale Tracker][1] is a good, old-fashioned tracker. It&#8217;s made to look like Fast Tracker II and is released for Windows and Linux. And guess what, an OS X version is in the works! These guys are great! The features I **really** love are these: 

- SoundFont support  
  
- Akai instrument support  
  
- Can be used as a VST instrument  
  
- Uses VST effects  
  
And yes, it&#8217;s all free (as in beer. I found no available sources). Can&#8217;t wait to put this on my Mac. For the meanwhile I&#8217;m fiddeling with it on a PC.
