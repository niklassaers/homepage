Hi. I came across [del.icio.us][1] in an Infoworld article, and figured: What if we make an RFC for categories. If we had a set of standardized categories people could choose to use, we could have blog indexes where we could subscribe on a category in a language as an rss feed and receive only interesting topics on that. An example of a category could be Music/Early Music/Renaissance, as opposed to Art/Renaissance/Vermeer. I&#8217;d love to receive blogging on Vermeer and Renaissance music without having to hunt these blogs down and add them to my RSS feed. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
