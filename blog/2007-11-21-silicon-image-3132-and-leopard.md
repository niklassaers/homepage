ZDNet posts that you should [beware of using][1] Silcion Image&#8217;s 3132 chipset that&#8217;s used for so many noname eSATA ExpressCards (and the one I have) with Leopard. I have had little success using this with Tiger as it seems incompatible with my enclosure (might as well be the other way around, though)
