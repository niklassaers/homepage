At work I&#8217;m looking at [PerformancePoint][1], and being a newbie with this product I of course do all the newbie errors. That&#8217;s why I was so happy when finding [Nick Barclay][2]&#8216;s blogpost where he explains all about the way-to-common [connection errors][3]. Big thank you to Nick. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
