I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.aei.mpg.de/~udif/UFRaw/" class="broken_link">UFRaw</a>, a [GIMP][1] plugin to work with the RAW shot of the moon. The images was quite under-exposed to start with, but still it gives me very many colours in the sky:  
![Luna, passed through GIMP and UFRaw][2]  
It uses [dcraw][3] that I [talked about earlier][4]. Do you have any experience with dcraw or utillities based on it you&#8217;d like to share? I&#8217;ll spend some time learning this tool so that I can get better results than this redish sky.
