I don&#8217;t play that many games, but one that I&#8217;ve enjoyed for a number of years has been The Sims. Now that Lion is out and we can talk about it, I found the answer about [what to do when it fails with an Unknown Error][1]: Go to ~/Library/Preferences and delete the com.transgaming.* files and the &#8220;The Sims 3 Preferences&#8221; directory. This will make the game run again.
