Funny thing, I&#8217;ve found two other blogs called The Early Music Blog [[1]][1] and [[2]][2]. [1] is Italian and hasn&#8217;t been updated since september and [2] is a republished version of <a href="http://goldbergweb.com/en/magazine" class="broken_link">Goldberg Magazine</a>. These two and other blogs I found or are emailed to me will be put in a feed and new updates from these blogs will be posted in the right-hand sidebar so that you can always have easy access to updated early music blogs (hopefully with original names, though, or we&#8217;ll have to come up with some kind of numbering system <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )
