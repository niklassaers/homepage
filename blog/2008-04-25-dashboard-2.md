It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote about what I&#8217;m doing, but nothing much has changed: I&#8217;m working with the iPhone SDK making different applications. Today I&#8217;d like to demo the application that made me start working with the iPhone: DashBoard. I first got interested with dashboards when I tried to make something userfriendly with Performance Point and [found IMA&#8217;s dashboard][1]. Now I&#8217;ve created a simple, easily customizable dashboard for the iPhone. Because of Apple&#8217;s NDA I cannot release it, but I believe I can show it to you, running on the simulator:

In this video you see a logo on top and nine KPI buttons below. Each KPI button has a logo, a number, a unit, a last-updated date and a colour to indicate if it&#8217;s as it should be, falling below target or significantly below target (in other words, if there is a problem), using green, yellow and red. When you tap a KPI button, the report is displayed. The report is just a webpage, so I&#8217;ve linked up a webpage for every KPI button showing just a normal webpage, but more interestingly I think: PDF reports. As you can see, it works beautiful with 154 page reports, even though I guess for actually using this, you&#8217;d use a page or three with lots of graphs. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

PS, yes, my conservatory exam preparations are going well <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
