  <p>I'd been doing my dishes. I'm not always the first to clear the stuff away, and here I was coming back from practising and found that the light from my powerbook was giving it a nice light, so yet another opportunity to use my manual focus lenses to do something fun. Autofocus would be no benefit here as it would just be jogging all over the place. Shot at f/2.8 in 15 seconds with 100 ISO</p>
