One of my favourite quotes from Mattheson&#8217;s *Der vollkommene Capellmeister* is from the foreword: &#8220;&#8230;the four principal rivers wich originate ther [in Paradise]. But now the most common opinion on the location of Paradise is that it was situated in Mesopotamia toward Armenia, thus Eden must have been on the land which stretches between the Tigris and Euphrates up to the Armenian mountains. Certainly a fine spot!&#8221;

Certainly a fine spot indeed. Looks like a great place for a holiday trip. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
