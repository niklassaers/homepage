Eik Bank, who in 2007 <a href="http://www.eikbank.dk/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF-dokumenter/Pressemeddelelser/29052007_Pressemeddelelse.pdf" class="broken_link">bought the Danish part of Skandiabanken</a> and thus got me as its customer, is in trouble. The share has [fallen from ~86 DKK in august to ~30 DKK today][1], the board has resigned, the FÃ¦roe government is [wondering if they can bail it out][2]. Apparently [the 9,1 million DKK guarantee the Danish government gave is worthless][3], the same article notes that the security behind the bank is stock in the bank and a failed construction company, so [now they&#8217;re frantically trying to sell the Danish part][4], the one they bought in 2007. [The Danish Finance Ministery guarantees that all deposits are safe][5], but nowhere do I see that means that customers will actually be able to access their money/pay their bills. A similar uncertainty was in Norway when the Icelandic bank Kaupting was put under administration and people&#8217;s money were safe but unavailable. (English readers, see <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/business/119-business/50096-faroese-bank-shutters-danish-subsidiary.html" class="broken_link">this summary article on Eik Banks trouble</a>)

This is where it gets interesting: The Danish part is an Internet only bank. The customers are people who are used to using the net, and thus quickly find out what&#8217;s going out. They usually also have a second bank, so all the ~100.000 customers going online and transferring their money to another bank should be a relatively quick thing. *Thus we have a virtual run on the bank.* Not queues as we know them, but lots and lots of transactions. And besides the run, who is going to want to buy an server-infrastructure with ~100.000 empty accounts?

So how serious is this? Just me pulling my money? Well, two days ago an ATM refused to talk to Eik Bank anymore, the first time I have experienced that. No problem with my other cards. Then todays headlines. Quite serious, and the news in danish TV isn&#8217;t helping them either. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how this plays out. How this plays out will probably shape internet-only banks for a very long time to come. And that&#8217;s a banking concept I&#8217;ve been very fond of since I became a Skandiabanken customer in Norway a long, long time ago.
