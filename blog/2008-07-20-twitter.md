It seems you cannot use the iPhone 2.0 firmware without a Twitter account, so I [got one][1]. First I started by adding some developers that I think do cool stuff. But then I got to thinking, who of my friends and contact are in there? Twitter isn&#8217;t great at bulk importing, so to help me, I found [TwitterWho][2] where I could mark all my contacts in my address book, copy their names, paste it into the box and off it went and found everyone. Yay! How if I can only find a way to automatically look up Facebook friends on Twitter&#8230;. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
