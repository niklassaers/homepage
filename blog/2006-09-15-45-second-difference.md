What a difference 45 seconds makes! I had a cup of the 176C &#8211; 2m, 204C &#8211; 3m, 232C &#8211; 3m that I roasted the 12th, which is 45 seconds shorter than the roast of the 10th and it&#8217;s got so much less flavour. It still tastes nice, but there are big things missing. Very interesting since these 45 seconds were slashed because I thought they&#8217;d need to be less burnt, not because I heared a crack earlier.
