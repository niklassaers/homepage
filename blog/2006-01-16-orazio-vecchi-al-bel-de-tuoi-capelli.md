[Christian ][1] and Annette Mondrup maintain <a href="http://www.saers.com/recorder/mondrup/" class="broken_link">an archive of scores</a> for recorder ensembles. The latest addition is a madrigal consisting of 8 parts for 5 voices: <a href="http://www.saers.com/recorder/mondrup/Composers/Vecchi.html" class="broken_link"><em>Al bel de tuoi capelli</em></a> by Orazio Vecchi (1550-1605). The score is complete with text, so should be nice for singing as well.
