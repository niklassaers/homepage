ubd wanted to connect to windows.net, so I looked it up, and it belongs to Ubiquity.framework, that is a part of the iCloud integration. Hmm&#8230;

The man-page says this: &#8220;ubd is the ubiquity server process. It is primarily used for &#8220;Mobile Documents. There are no configuration options to ubd, and users should not run ubd manually.&#8221;
