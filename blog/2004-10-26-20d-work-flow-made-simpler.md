[Dave Coffin][1] has made *dcraw* work for OS X by a couple of support mails. Grab [the source code][2] and compile with *gcc -g draw.c -lm -DNO_JPEG -o dcraw* or [get the binaries][3] from [Francisco Montilla][4].

My workflow is now: download RAW images from the camera into folder, do all my regular post-processing (auto-colour, auto-levels, make jpeg) and then import to iPhoto. I used Canon&#8217;s own software for the RAW handelling first, but it&#8217;s got clumsy select mechanisms. Now I get it all just the way I like it. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> (shell handelling of graphics has been my main preference since 1999, but of course I&#8217;ll use a graphic editing program for non-typical operations. Far better than automate-functions in Photoshop <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )

Many thanks to Dave and Francisco for their help in getting dcraw working with the 20D on my OS X box.
