A while ago I was pointed at [Noise Ninja][1] which is a great program for reducing picture noise. While investigating, I found a few other options, but no open source options. Looking at it again today I found that there are a few plugins for [The GIMP][2] in the works: most notably <a href="http://registry.gimp.org/plugin?id=5610" class="broken_link">Dcam Noise 2</a>, but also <a href="http://registry.gimp.org/plugin?id=6719" class="broken_link">ISO noise reduction</a>. I wonder what&#8217;s keeping the open source world away on this, but I&#8217;m glad to see someone&#8217;s working on it at least. At the moment I&#8217;m just adding a bit of blur to my images using [GIMPShop][3] and \*shriek\* iPhoto 5
