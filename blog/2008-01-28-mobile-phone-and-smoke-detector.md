This is just the weirdest. Not three minutes ago my Norwegian mobile phone that I haven&#8217;t had turned on since christmas suddenly turned itself on, and just a second thereafter my smoke alarm went bananas. I can smell no smoke, no smoke outside, no smoke in the entrance, not anywhere. What&#8217;s going on? Normally I would just assume it malfunctioned, but my mobile phone turned itself on! It shouldn&#8217;t be able to do that??
