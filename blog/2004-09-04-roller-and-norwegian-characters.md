Hi. I&#8217;m having a bit of trouble using [Roller][1] for [Ingeborg&#8217;s homepage][2]. I&#8217;ve set the characterset to be ISO-8859-1, yet all norwegian characters end up as question marks in the HTML. The database contains the posts with Norwegian characters, so something weird happens on its way through Roller. Checked this with version 0.9.8.1 and 0.9.8.2. [Apparently][3] this is still true with 0.9.9. Time to finally ditch Roller (and go for WordPress?)? I like the system, but it keeps failing on me and not having a big community making plugins and such for it, there&#8217;s not really that much to hold on to. Or is there? Input is most welcome! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

UPDATE: Lance [sais he&#8217;s fixed the issue][4]. And the <a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20040707#try_roller_it_s_easy" class="broken_link">Roller Demo</a> with Tomcat5, JSPWiki and Roller set up out of the box is quite nice <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
