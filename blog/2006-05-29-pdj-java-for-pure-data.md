Too cool! Today I found [pdf][1] which is Pure Data&#8217;s take on mxj. It&#8217;s supposed to be API compatible with mxj, which is **great** because that&#8217;s what I use for all my Java-based externals. Suddenly I feel like I&#8217;m in the open again after having been digging myself further and further into Max/MSP. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Max/MSP is nice but Pure Data is closer to my heart. Well, as far as software goes, anyways. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
