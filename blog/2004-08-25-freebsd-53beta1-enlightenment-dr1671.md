<a href="http://bsdnews.com/view_story.php3?story_id=4689" class="broken_link">FreeBSD 5.3-BETA1 is available</a>, happy testing, everyone. Also, the long avaited <a href="http://enlightenment.org/pages/news.html" class="broken_link">Enlightenment</a> DR16.7.1 has been released. I don&#8217;t know how many years ago Enlightenment was my favourite deskmanager. Year 2000 or thereabouts, perhaps. Congratulations! Perhaps I&#8217;ll give this a spin sometime soon. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
