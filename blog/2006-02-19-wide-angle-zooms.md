<a href="http://www.saers.com/~mognes" class="broken_link">Mogens</a>&#8216; Canon 10-22mm [rocks][1]. That was what I read out of the [lineup of Nikon, Sigma, Tokina and Tamron wide-angle zoom leenses][2]. It&#8217;s conclusion was to buy a Nikon, but further down argues that he prefers the Canon with lower distortion and price. I&#8217;ll borrow Mogens&#8217; lens and put some [pictures here][3]. Meanwhile, my take on wide angle has been my [Canon 20mm f/2.8][4] (hmm, no pictures online yet, I&#8217;ll have to do something about that. I&#8217;ve had the lens for like half a year now) and fish eye lens adapters like the [0.42x][5] I was [sent instead of what I&#8217;d actually bought][6] or my father&#8217;s 180 degrees fisheye adapter. That works well also, but 10mm is awesome!
