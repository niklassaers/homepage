As promised Nik & Mogens have made the first podcast for the Early Music Blog. It&#8217;s available for download [here][1]. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to it you can use iTunes (select Subscribe to Podcast from the Advanced menu) or any other podcast capable program and use the link <a href="http://earlymusicblog.net/?feed=rss2&category_name=Podcasts" class="broken_link">http://earlymusicblog.net/?feed=rss2&category_name=Podcasts</a>.

This first podcast includes the Sarabande from Philidor&#8217;s 10Ã¨me suite that we played in concert in the beginning of April. The rest of the parts will come in later podcasts. It refers to [this blogpost about Philidor&#8217;s notation][2].

This is our first ever podcast so please be gentle, the more we learn the better the quality of these episodes will be. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
