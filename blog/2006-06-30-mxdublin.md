From [the website][1]: *mxdublin is a Java/Python framework that can be used to sequence generic events with pure-data or max*. In short: very cool, an easier way of Max/MSP or PureData scripting for us who are more into lines of text than objects and lines. Basically they use Jython and mxj, which means that I&#8217;m looking forward to mxdublin~ based on mxj~ <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Downloading and getting ready to install.
