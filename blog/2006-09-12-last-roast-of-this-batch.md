I&#8217;m just not concentrating today (too much coffee?) so I&#8217;m roasting the last 150 grams of Miscela d&#8217;Oro: 160C &#8211; 5m, 190C &#8211; 4m, 196C &#8211; 2m, 204C &#8211; 1m, 210C &#8211; 1m30s. I was inspired by Randy&#8217;s [iRoast 2 review][1] and Ryan&#8217;s summary of [his first day][2] with the iRoast 2. Now I&#8217;ve placed my order for a Miscela Due Doppio from Risteriet, which is 80% arabica and 20% robusta. I&#8217;ve heared robusta gives more crema, which is what I&#8217;m hunting for at the moment. The cups taste spectacular already. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
