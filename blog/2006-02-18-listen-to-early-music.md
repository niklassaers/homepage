Listen to original recordings of early music. ThatÂ´s a dream we all share, because we will never be able to know exactly how old music was played in its time. This is not possible &#8211; but IÂ´ve just discovered a homepage where it is possible to listen to very early music. Both wax cylinders an tinfoil recordings gathered right here at [tinfoil.com][1]. Interesting to hear how people sang and played around 1890-1913; in the years just before the sinking of Titanic (yes! it is possible to hear a recording of Â´Nearer My God to TheeÂ´ from those years!) Well, have a listen (and a laugh). [Cylinders of the month!][2] <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
