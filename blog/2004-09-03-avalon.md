I&#8217;m very glad he does, and to have discussions like this in a public forum is great. I don&#8217;t totally buy the *SVG and CSS both were passed on because they weren&#8217;t adaquate to meet our needs.* I&#8217;ve heared this way to many times before as an excuse to reinvent the wheel and having to answer to no-one. Although it&#8217;s not *embrace and extend* we&#8217;re used to, I would have preferred them to implement standards correctly and then make additions through contributing to standard bodies like W3C.
