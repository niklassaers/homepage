Today I have done what everyone plans to do and no-one ever does (1). I&#8217;ve been studying statistics at uni all day! And I actually got quite a bit done, covering a fourth of the material and several weeks worth of tutes. Then I had a chat with David who&#8217;s in Bankok, and now I&#8217;m on my way to choir practise. This has been a dramatic improvement of yesterday where I played with my ensemble in church and then waited for falling stars at night. I didn&#8217;t get anything smart done during the day (I had a lovely chat with a great friend of mine, though <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) and although they had predicted hundreds and thousands, I only got to see two falling stars. Oh well, I made a wish anyway. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
