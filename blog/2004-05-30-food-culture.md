I&#8217;m shocked! I read *Fast Food Nation* about two years ago and didn&#8217;t like it much because as I was reading mainly science at the time, its &#8220;proofs&#8221; didn&#8217;t hold one bit and it was through-and-through pop. Bo-ring. Anyways, reading my regular blogs, this guy concluded he eats fast-food 3-4 times a week. I knew there were differences in european and american eating culture, but is this really representative? Should I eat a fast-food menu once every two or three weeks, I&#8217;d find that really depressing, and the occational saussage I eat when too busy when I&#8217;m in Oslo is not a good thing. It&#8217;s not filling like regular food is. Hope this is just one standing out, but with the movie *Supersize me* he was referring to and *Fast Food Nation* and countless american shows, I&#8217;m beginning to wonder
