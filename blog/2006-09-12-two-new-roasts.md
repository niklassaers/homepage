Having read the iRoast 2 review at Coffee Geek I couldn&#8217;t help myself and roasted two new batches: 150g of cold Miscela d&#8217;Oro (100% arabica). One roasted at 190C &#8211; 5m, 208C &#8211; 6m, 232C &#8211; 2m30s. The second one was at 196C &#8211; 1m, 222C &#8211; 3m and 240C &#8211; 2m. With these two profiles in addition to the first one (176C &#8211; 2m, 204C &#8211; 3m, 232C &#8211; 3m), it&#8217;ll be an interesting day saturday or sunday when I get to taste all three of them. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
