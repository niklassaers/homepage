A little note to Dan & David from [their latest show on CRAP][1], iTunes&#8217; EULA and DRM technology <a href="http://forbrukerportalen.no/Artikler/2006/1138119849.71" class="broken_link">is considered illegal in Norway</a> according to the consumer rights watch. This is all over the news today. So publicity is coming on DRM technologies.
