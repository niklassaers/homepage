Finally, my lenses have arrived. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> They are so much fun, and as soon as I get back to Denmark I&#8217;ll be sure to post some pictures taken with them. In the meanwhile, read [this nice review][1] which compares the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 to the Canon 35mm f/2 lens. The Tamron is a bit confusing, zooming the opposite way from all my other lenses, and it makes quite much noise while focussing. But that is very easily forgiven because of the nice images it takes. A little bit anoying that it doesn&#8217;t have full time manual focusing, though. And it says very clearly &#8220;do not use 2x converters with this lens&#8221;. Why not? I&#8217;ll have to figure that one out.
