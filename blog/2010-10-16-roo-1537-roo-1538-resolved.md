I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve noticed yet, but I&#8217;m a big fan of both Roo and the guys behind Roo. Big thanks to Alan & James from [the forum post][1], <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-1537" class="broken_link">ROO-1537</a> and <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-1538" class="broken_link">ROO-1538</a>, as of git version a474dc7b95613fae564f0e0fa50d89a6818bd753, and tested today one day later, my scripts run flawlessly through the tests! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Which means, we can continue with Tiles. Stay tuned!
