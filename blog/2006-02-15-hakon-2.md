  <p>Shot at this years second thursday cafÃ© at the conservatory. I'm practicing portrait photography using my dad's 30-something year old Yashica lens and getting great results. These next few pictures will be from this session, but this is the only coloured one. Shot at f/1.2 in 1/80 sec with 1600 ISO.</p>
