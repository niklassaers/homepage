I&#8217;m still a Max/MSP junkie ([Max 5 was released today!!][1]) and so I&#8217;m happy to present my new interface for Max: LightingMatrix

As you can see, LightingMatrix is a matrix of black buttons that light up when you press them and then fade down. When I get my certificate and get to put it on the iTunes App Store, you&#8217;ll see that you can use multiple fingers. The values are sent via UDP to Max where you can use it just like any other control. I look forward to seeing what splendid software-synth, lighting, moving robot or other fun stuff you&#8217;re going to be making with this. The power of tapping with many fingers is available, now also for Max/MSP (and Jitter) <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
