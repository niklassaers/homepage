Yay, my picture was selected for the Pixos #30 challenge <a href="http://www.pixos.net/gallery/2004/30/#414" class="broken_link">Macines in&#8230;</a> gallery. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Should you be interested, this is my mobile phone now: 

<a href="http://niklas.saers.com/blog/wp-content/images/_MG_2293.jpg" onclick="window.open(&#039;http://niklas.saers.com/blog/wp-content/images/_MG_2293.jpg&#039;,&#039;popup&#039;,&#039;width=3512,height=2338,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0&#039;);return false" class="broken_link"><img src="http://niklas.saers.com/blog/wp-content/images/_MG_2293-tm.jpg" height="360" width="540" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="_MG_2293.jpg" title="_MG_2293.jpg" /></a> 

The people I asked to repair it don&#8217;t want to change the glass only like I asked them to, and ask for &#8364;300 to change the entire display, and hold my phone as hostage at the same time. So it seems there&#8217;ll be no more fancy phones for me.
