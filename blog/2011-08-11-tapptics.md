I thought I&#8217;d give [Tapptics][1] a little plug. I love writing nice applications for the iPhone, but taking on a graphics artist for pet projects is sometimes a bit hard to justify. But a while ago I read about Tapptics and saw their site and bookmarked <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mobile-design-tutorials/introduction-to-iphone-design/" class="broken_link">the article</a> so I could come back to it when I had a project where I needed some graphics. That time has come, so I signed up and it&#8217;s just a bucket full of resources, both nice tutorials and guides, and a lot of excellent graphics to use in my app. There were, however, two glyphs that I wanted that weren&#8217;t there, but no sooner had I enquired about them, had Jen whipped them up: two gorgeous glyphs that will have a prominent position in my app. The price is well worth it, so [go check Jen&#8217;s site out today][1]. If you&#8217;re an app developer and need nice graphics, you&#8217;ll love it! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
