Burning the midnight oil here. Seems Creative has <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/creativemail/FileSharing40.html" class="broken_link">an unsupported plugin</a> that not too many know about. It&#8217;s an iTunes plugin for the Nomad Jukeboxes. If someone had given this to me ages ago, I&#8217;d already been very happy for ages. Anyways, I&#8217;m very happy now. Thanks to the guys at NomadNess for helping out on this
