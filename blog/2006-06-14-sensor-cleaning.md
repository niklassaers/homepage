I recently bought a sensor cleaning kit with a blower and two brushes not very unlike the one [featured here][1]. [Luminous Landscape has a great article][2] on sensor cleaning that I followed. So here follow a few pictures from my cleaning session. It should be noted that I have tried cleaning it with a swab and some lens cleaning stuff before so rather than being nicely spread out, my dust was here and there collected in little stacks. Have a look at the changes. I did three sweeps and got to the point where I couldn&#8217;t quickly spot any dust. Bonus points to find dust I didn&#8217;t spot. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> The entire thing took about 5 minutes:

The following two cleaning pages are also nice: [photo.net][3] and <a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/content_page.asp?cid=7-6460-7296" class="broken_link">Rob Galbraith</a>.
