Dear Friends, Followers, and random people of the internet,

Christina and I are expecting, and we just found out yesterday: it&#8217;s going to be a boy! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> The doctors think he&#8217;ll arrive December 27th, we expect him to be a bit early.

We&#8217;ve been through all the usual tests, and everything looks good. He&#8217;s alive an kicking! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> So we couldn&#8217;t be happier, and it&#8217;s going to be an amazing change of life.

Cheers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christina & Niklas
