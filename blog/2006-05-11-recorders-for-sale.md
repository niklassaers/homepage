  <p>Again I'm shooting with my 28mm f/2.8 manual focus lens, this time at 400 ISO in 1/60 second. This David Coomber Fehrn 415 recorder in american boxwood and Bodil Diesen 440 recorder in european boxwood are for sale at the moment, and I'm rather pleased with the picture taken of them on top of the piano forte.</p>
