Time Machine included in Leopard backs up your ~/Library/Caches unless you explicitly ask it not to. Just something to make a choice about when setting up your hourly backups. I do my backups to a remote disk, so I certainly would not like to every hour have my last hour of browsing backuped. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
