[Zoto][1] looks really nice, and I should visit it frequently because it has no RSS feed. Ehm&#8230;. that of course means, I&#8217;m putting the picture gallery for blogs up here and hope that I come back for it. I first read about this at PhotoMatt today, and even though he sais WordPress is not supported, <a href="http://choysan.zoto.com/wordpress/" class="broken_link">obviously</a> they&#8217;re working at it. I&#8217;ll give &#8216;em a ping and ask for that RSS feed. I love image RSS feeds! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Fresh photos, a glance of people&#8217;s lives without reading all the time. Call me lazy, but I&#8217;ve always loved photos <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
