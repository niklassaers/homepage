As you might have noticed, I&#8217;m trying out different kinds of content on my blog lately. It&#8217;s all stuff I love doing, just interesting trying out new stuff. Next up on &#8220;new ideas&#8221; is &#8220;easter ales 2011&#8243;, where I thought I&#8217;d introduce this years crop of easter ale available in Danish supermarkets.

[<img src="http://blog.saers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/foto-e1301325678774-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Påskeæg by Thisted Bryghus" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-939" />][1]First up is <a href="http://www.thisted-bryghus.dk/Default.aspx?ID=13" class="broken_link">Påskeæg, økologisk påskebryg</a> by Thisted bryghus. It&#8217;s much like a traditional pils, so if you like a classic pils you&#8217;ll love this beer. It&#8217;s slightly sweet from the malte, but the hop taste is prominently bitter.

A bit too light for my preference in easter ales, but not a bad start on this short series. I&#8217;m usually a big fan of Thisted Bryghus, so I think I&#8217;ll stick with some of their other beers.
