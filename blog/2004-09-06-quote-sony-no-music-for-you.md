I wanted to try out Sony&#8217;s online music store, but it seems it requires Explorer. [Try this with Safari][1] and feel the rejection. This is not the way to do business. My most recent experience with this is that I askes the Skype developers for beta access to their OS X software and they were making money of me in no time (and I&#8217;m dialling far more frequent to Norway now). How about that music, Sony?
