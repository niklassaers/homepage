To quote Jan Eggum: &#8220;Kor e alle heltane&#8221; (where are all our heroes, for you non-norwegians). [Dennis Ritchie][1] <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP?hl=en" class="broken_link">passed away today</a>. That is Richie as in &R in [K&R][2] C, or [The Book][3]. Without Dennis, I&#8217;d probably not known my good friend [Dag-Erling][4]. I&#8217;d probably be writing Pascal. I&#8217;d probably given up on computing after having led <a href="http://www.intrafoundation.com/foundation/demos.html" class="broken_link">the DemOS project</a> in assembler and Pascal. [Dag-Erling][5] would not have been a [FreeBSD][6] [committer][7]. I would not have written [my thesis about the FreeBSD project][8]. There would be no Mac OS X, or iPhone. At least not the way we know it. There would be no /dev.

It was a sad moment [when Steve died][9], and although Dennis was allowed to live many more years, it is too soon to see another giant in our industry go away. I am deeply thankful for what he has given our community, and for what he has given me, and most of the people I know in our industry.

There have been many obituaries, but the one I liked the best is [written by Poul-Henning Kamp at Version2][10] (in Danish).
