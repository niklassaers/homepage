The new harpsichord at school has arrived. Due to what&#8217;s called a wormhole in the wood, I&#8217;m calling him (it&#8217;s CLEARLY a male instrment) Grima. Weee!! He sounds great. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Now we just have to put the old one into shape.
