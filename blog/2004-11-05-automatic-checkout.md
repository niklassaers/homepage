Ed Gottsman [writes about][1] RFID tags for ZDNet and sais it could eliminate check-out and just deduct the money from your VISA card as you leave the store. Don&#8217;t know about you, but I find way to often that stores overcharge me and don&#8217;t give the price as advertised unless I point it out for them. And this is with identifying technologies as barcodes. So I guess I won&#8217;t be the one cheering when my VISA bill is way larger then what it should be because I wasn&#8217;t able to say to anyone &#8220;now, look here, in your ad you say it costs this but you&#8217;re still charging me double&#8221;.
