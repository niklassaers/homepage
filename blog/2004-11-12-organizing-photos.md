I just saw [PicoJet&#8217;s flash-based ad][1] (via [The Digital Photography Weblog][2]). PicaJet is software for organizing my photos, not much unlike iPhoto. I&#8217;m really fond of iPhoto, except that it&#8217;s too slow and that labelling and organizing pictures still takes too long. I miss RAW-support and search-functionality like [imgSeek][3]. I love the <a href="gallery.sourceforge.net" class="broken_link">Gallery</a> [plugin][4], despite rotation bugs. I&#8217;m currently sticking with iPhoto 2 as I figure it&#8217;s been so long since the release of iPhoto 4 that a new version is bound to be due soon. But as with all other photo-organizing software I&#8217;ve seen, PicaJet & iPhoto have a problem with DVDs.

With my recent purchase of my Canon EOS 20D, the amount of pictures I take has risen sharply. And the file size of my favourite format has risen for each picture from ~400k to ~6m. Within three weeks I&#8217;d taken 4Gb of pictures, nicely fitted on one DVD. But, that&#8217;s making my pictures unavailable. I need to have a thumb-nail in my archive (say about 640&#215;480 would be nice) that informs me what DVD I&#8217;ve put it on so I can find it back. I&#8217;ve got a 15cm stack of photo DVDs and the occational photo CD. I need this to become available. How have you guys solved this?
