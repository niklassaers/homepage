  <p>During our trip to 'dyreskoven' we visited several different kinds of deer. These were by far the cutest, although they had to be persuaded to come to us. Luckily my girlfriend had brought loads of bread while I was clicking away. They were rather suspicious to this guy with a box that sais click, but the bread was just too tempting.
