[FixPicture][1] is a nice little site that helped me with converting a PSF file (ArcSoft PhotoStudio format) to JPG. I had received this file as an attachment by a user who couldn&#8217;t know this was a nonstandard format, and since I didn&#8217;t have any software that could read it (as far as I know), this site was very useful. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
