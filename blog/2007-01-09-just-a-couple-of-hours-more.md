![Apple Store being updated][1] 
I&#8217;m waiting attentively. Wonder what goodies Macworld &#8217;07 will bring. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I admit it, I&#8217;ve become some sort of a fan. But in my defence: **THEY STARTED IT!** They took FreeBSD and NetBSD and threw a great UI on top of it and sold computers that were set up in a way I liked it with this preinstalled. Hmm&#8230;.! Waiting&#8230;.
