In <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/08/video_communica.html" class="broken_link">Marc&#8217;s Voice</a> today, Marc shows <a href="http://momentshowing.typepad.com/momentshowing/files/8.21.04.mp4" class="broken_link">this video</a> of [Momentshowing][1]. I don&#8217;t know about the guy who made this, but this kind of thing freaks me out. He&#8217;s assuming that just because a person is outside, he has the right to videotape him and show him around to everyone. Assuming, of course, that the story is true and not just produced. This is why people are afraid of cellphones with videocameras and such, that people will just allow themselves to not only watch people and stalk people, but do it with the world as their audience. What do you think about this?
