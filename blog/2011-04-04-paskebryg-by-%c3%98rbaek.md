[<img src="http://blog.saers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1681-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Påskebryg by Ørbæk" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-966" />][1]Påskebryg by [Ørbæk bryggeri][2] was an instant hit. It has quite a strong taste, with a surprisingly lack of after-taste. It has a very nice foam, has lots of spice and hop, and is moderately sweet.

In color its dark, and you can&#8217;t see trough the glass, it&#8217;s too misty / unfiltered for that. It has an average amount of gas, and will go well with most kinds of food. This beer is an excellent replacement for a good glass of wine, and can be had by itself. Only weird thing is that if you served this to me as a christmas beer, in my ignorance I wouldn&#8217;t know better than to call it an excellent christmas beer as well. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

All in all, a great beer that I&#8217;ll definitely have another of. And many bonus points for the nice hare on the label <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
