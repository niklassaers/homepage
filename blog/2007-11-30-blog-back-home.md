I&#8217;ve moved my blog and photoblog back home. A few of my other sites might follow. I&#8217;m hoping to have them better integrated so. At the moment people will come up to me and say &#8216;I saw your home page!&#8217; and I&#8217;ll ask them which one. Not a good place to be. I&#8217;ve been planning an integrated solution for a year without really having had the time for it, but having it back home might actually do some good for those plans. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
