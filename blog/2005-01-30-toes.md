According to <a href="http://www.anopenshutter.com/blog/" class="broken_link">An Open Shutter</a>, his most searched for word is toes. Funny thing. <a href="http://www.saers.com/stats/saers.com/blog/usage_200501.html" class="broken_link">So far</a> my top search word is [47th street photo][1]. The more nerdy words score good as well. What search words bring in people with you? And how do you bring people to your site and keep them coming back? I stick with my photos and hope someone will bother with my ramblings as well. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
