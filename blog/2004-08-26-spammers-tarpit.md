[Spammers tarpit][1] has been posted. It&#8217;s a plugin that&#8217;s supposed to ask spammers to go away. Not an ideal solution as far as I can say. I&#8217;d prefer just increasing the delay, first a minute, then a minute and a half, until they go away. Using bad language isn&#8217;t any much help. And oh, it has it&#8217;s bugs. When posting this, my screen reads: *Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /disks/ideraid1/web/saers.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/tarpit.php on line 51*. Go figure. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> But good to see that people are working on this, and good luck to the developers continuing the development.

Update: this bug is due to that they don&#8217;t add a list of IPs. So you&#8217;ll have to figure that one out for yourself, make an array of IPs. Like I&#8217;m going to add that to my daily workload. No thanks. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
