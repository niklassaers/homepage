I&#8217;m planning to get more away from my computer with my camera, and I&#8217;ve been looking at solutions for emptying my CF-card onto a harddrive while travelling. My most probable choice is [CompactDrive PD7X][1] (which I&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.kvalitetsvaruhus.se/butik/solo-k.asp?id=4586" class="broken_link">buy here</a> unless someone gives me a better offer), but I&#8217;m also looking at [Archos][2] [AV420][3] that has too many features I don&#8217;t need and the [Epson P-2000][4] that has some great reviews, is an image browser as well and supports Canon&#8217;s RAW format, but has more than twice the price-tag.
