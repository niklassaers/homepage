  <p>Look at the definitions for <a href="http://www.pochendorfer.com/macchiato/macchiato.html">Macchiato</a>. To make it all more confusing, I've called my coffee Machiatto. It's a single shot of espresso with a little bit of steamed skimmed milk and a bit of foam on top. Here in a JÃ¤germeister shot glass next to my espresso machine. Taken at f/4.5 at 1600 ISO in 1/15 second. PS, my understanding of a macchiato is a shot of espresso with full a little bit of full cream that has been slightly whipped (this is how the coffee bar Fredrik at the University of Oslo makes it). And since I'm not too fond of cream, the Machiatto is a great improvement.</p>
