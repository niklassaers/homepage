Monday evening I had my first real stab at tuning a harpsichord. I&#8217;d been given an introduction by Jan the week before, and now was my chance to try it out (he&#8217;d come and tune it later as he always tunes it monday evening or tuesday morning). It actually went surprisingly well. Lots of it was in reasonable good tune when I left it. I first tuned it as I has learned, and then of course started tuning a couple of intervals I did not like, which led to other itervals I did not like, and so on&#8230; so after about two hours of this I figured that enough was enough and did my harpsichord lesson instead. And it wasn&#8217;t at all bad playing the pieces. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
