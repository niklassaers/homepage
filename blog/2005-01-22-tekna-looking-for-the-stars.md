The Norwegian language has a problem: there is no such word as management. The word we use for management is leading, which as even a pre-first year management student knows is just a tiny fraction of it. In my experience, many Norwegian managers know nothing much about management. And since my experience is mainly from the IT sector, no wonder that the perhaps biggest organisation for technological and natural sciences professionals, [Tekna][1] arranges a course in [Astrology and Management][2] (ok, Astrology and Leading is the actual title, but from the text they obviously mean management)

Thanks to [Erik Tunstad][3] for bringing this up
