When Steve Jobs announced that the iPhone would be running OS X, I thought to myself that that&#8217;s just what he sais: it will have the same userinterface, but he&#8217;s not going to keep the core there: the BSD subsystem. Looks like he has, though, and [now people are SSH&#8217;ing into the phone][1]. That suddenly made the whole phone very much more appealing. I&#8217;ll still need 3G and a decent camera, though. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> At the moment, my k800i is doing both camera and MP3s all right, but then again, it has no BSD subsystem. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
