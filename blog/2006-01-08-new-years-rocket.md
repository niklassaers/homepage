  <p>I was planning on taking a lot of rocket shots this new years eve, but unfortunately someone in the party desided we should go into a tall building to get a better view and the door to the balcony was shut, so we ended up looking at it through some office windows that had a rather bad reflection. So I didn't get any good shots, and this one, that was really only a test-shot to see if I had got the settings like I wanted them to, was the closest I came. Shot in 4/5 seconds at f/2.8 with 400 ISO, 38mm</p>
