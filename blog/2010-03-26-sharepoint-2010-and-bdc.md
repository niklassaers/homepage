<p>Are you having any of the following problems?<br />
- In SharePoint Designer 2010, when you select &#8220;External Content Types&#8221;, you get &#8220;The Business Data Connectivity Metadata Store is currently unavailable.&#8221;<br />
- The Business Data Connectivity in Central Administration under Manage Service Applications gives you &#8220;Unrecognized attribute &#8216;allowInsecureTransport&#8217;. Note that attribute names are case-sensitive. (C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\WebClients\Bdc\client.config line 34)&#8221;<br />
- When you create a new Business Data Connectivity service you also get &#8220;Unrecognized attribute &#8216;allowInsecureTransport&#8217;. Note that attribute names are case-sensitive. (C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\WebClients\Bdc\client.config line 34)&#8221;</p>
<p>If so, hurry over to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976462"> and request the hotfix for SharePoint Foundation 2010.</p>
