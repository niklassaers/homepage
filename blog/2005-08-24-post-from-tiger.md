Hello Everyone,  
just trying out the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/blogs_forums/wordpressdash.html" class="broken_link">WordPressDash</a> widget for Tiger. I&#8217;ve been toying with Ecto a couple of times, but perhaps this will be my primary posting way from now on? I&#8217;ve tried so many different blog-clients, and I keep coming back to the webpage and simply writing my post. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Call me old-fashioned. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
