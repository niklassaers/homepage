Wow, it&#8217;s been ages, hasn&#8217;t it. Well, you&#8217;ll be all very pleased to hear that I&#8217;m studying for my exams that are coming up. In studying, I mean of course that I&#8217;ve taken up the keyboard again, started playing Beatles on my guitar, rehearsing Corelli, been having a concert with the choir (it went totally fabulous! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> And it was great standing on the gallery singing in a quartet while the rest of the choir was singing towards us with candles in their hands! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Magnificent!) and saying yes to play both for my job, for a choir that&#8217;s doing a Shutz-piece my choir also had parts of on the concert, and said ok to sing with another choir. Seriously, I have no clue why I study IT. I think it has something to do with sanity, but I begin to feel that I need some time off to study music. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;ve figured the best way to pick up my keyboard skills is to do La Folia in all scales. So that&#8217;s what I was doing just now. I made myself a cup of soup, but since I was so busy with the music, it I took a way to big cup, put the soup powder in and put too much water in it, so it&#8217;s more like reddish water. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Well, apart from music, Thu was visiting me all the way from Switzerland. I had a great time and I&#8217;m quite sure she did too. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> It was terriffic seeing her again. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> And I&#8217;m sure Anne Lise (hah, I insist on that spelling, thank you very much <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) called me for ages from Australia. I think she&#8217;s giving Optus a run for its money by using their deals to the fullest. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Oh well, back to the keyboard. And yes, I should be sleeping now. But then again, who shouldn&#8217;t? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
