  <p>This is a picture of <a href="http://www.nrk.no">NRK</a>s headquarters. NRK is Norways national broadcasting company. This time I went for a greener variant of sepia. The clock you see was a sign of NRK in the 70s and early 80s, so it fits the series on old lenses well. :-) The picture was taken at f/2.8 (as I cannot stop this lens down without modifying it) at ISO 100 in 1/800 second.</p>
