Dear Steve,  
you have shown us that we don&#8217;t understand what we think we understand, and must redo what we think is done, in order to go forward. You&#8217;ve tought us not to accept mediocracy, not from ourselves and not from the world around us. Strive for passionate perfection, every day, with love. Love for what we do and those that surround us.

Rest in Peace
