  <p>Me and my girlfriend were out in "Dyreparken" here in Esbjerg shooting deer (well, she was feeding them and has her regular fanclub down there :-) ) again. This time during the famous golden hours, and it's quite cool, in this picture you can actually see the sunset in the deer's eye. :-) I very much like that detail. Shot at f/2.8 in 1/160 seconds with 200 ISO giving me a -0.33 exposure bias that I have corrected for during postprocessing. Other than that I haven't done much to the picture except for adding a tan of saturation.</p>
