Way cool, a composer/musician/LDAP-developer has made [Mono run on iPhone][1]. Jailbreaked, by the look of it, looking forward to seeing it compile with the official iPhone SDK as well and a Mono Touch library. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
