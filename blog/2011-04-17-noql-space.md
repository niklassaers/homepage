These days I&#8217;m heavily looking into the NoSQL space, and I&#8217;ve currently limited my learning to the document space of CouchDB, MongoDB, key/value space of AWS SimpleDB and Cassandra, and the Neo4J graph space. For the projects I&#8217;m involved in I&#8217;m most excited about Couch & Mongo, even though I&#8217;d love to host it in the AWS space and therefore should be looking at SimpleDB.

If you&#8217;re exploring this space as well, I&#8217;d love to hear from you and your thoughts. Many more posts are bound to come <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
