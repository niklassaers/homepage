A raid disk failed at work. HP box, RAID controller, replacing the disk was done in a sec:

`<br />
ciss0: *** Hot-plug drive removed: SCSI port 1 ID 1<br />
ciss0: *** Hot-plug drive inserted: SCSI port 1 ID 1<br />
ciss0: *** State change, logical drive 0<br />
ciss0: logical drive 0 (da0) changed status interim recovery->ready for recovery, spare status 0x0<br />
ciss0: *** State change, logical drive 0<br />
ciss0: logical drive 0 (da0) changed status ready for recovery->recovering, spare status 0x0<br />
`

However, going with two IDE disks and FreeBSD&#8217;s ATARAID gave not even a panic, just instant boot. Still work to be done.
