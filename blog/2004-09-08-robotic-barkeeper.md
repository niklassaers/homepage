[Paul Lamere][1] can tell about a robotic barkeeper that will serve you a drink at a spoken request, and tell jokes while it&#8217;s making them. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> I&#8217;m hoping that version two can juggle the bottles, make recommendations, improvise new drinks depending on the users, eh, customers mood and send drinks to the girl in that sparkling red top. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> And of course, I expect it to pass all sanetary tests. How often do you wash your hands, little robot? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
