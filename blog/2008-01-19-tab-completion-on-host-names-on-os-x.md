I don&#8217;t know if this is bash or an OS X feature, but nonetheless: today I discovered that there&#8217;s tab-completion that takes .ssh/config into account! I on-instinct did a tab after writing part of the hostname I wanted and (boom!) there it was, auto-completed with a colon. So to SSH to my mini I did &#8220;ssh mi<tab>&#8221; and go &#8220;scp mini:&#8221;. If this is the bash-guys or the darwin guys, I don&#8217;t know, I hope to find out. Nonetheless: a big thank-you! <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
