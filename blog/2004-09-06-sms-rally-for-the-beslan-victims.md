An SMS rally in Norway that asked people to light a candle for the Beslan (Russia) victims [led to the Red Cross being given one million norwegian crowns][1] (Norwegian article). 1.050.000, really. 1.5 million SMS&#8217;es were sent, and Telenor, Norways biggest phone company, gives the surplus to the Red Cross, which in turn will send even more help to Beslan within this week. I received these SMS&#8217;es both in Norwegian and Danish, so perhaps this has happened other places in the world as well? More info in Norwegian [here][2].
