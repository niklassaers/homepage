About 11.50 today we could read that [Scream [and the Madonna has been] stolen from Norway museum][1]. Not in BBC World, of course, but in [Aftenposten][2] and at [NRK][3]. Four, then three, and now two armed & masked robbers have stolen Munch&#8217;s paintings Scream and the Madonna, and the museums expect a demand for randsom. This is not the first time Norwegian treasures like this are stolen (if you can read Norwegian, see [this story in VG][4]), but luckily they have so far usually turned up again after some time. After all, would you let anyone into your home knowing you had a hot painting in it?
