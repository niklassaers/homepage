Todays cups were the four day old roast of preset 1 (only two handfulls of beans left) and the five day old very dark roast of preset 2.

The preset 1 was the first one to go. The beans made just a double basket at setting 4 on the Rocky. How little coffee two handfulls of beans give doesn&#8217;t cease to amaze me. The crema was there but by the end of the pull it was &#8220;pushed away&#8221; by the last five seconds of drops. There wasn&#8217;t too much crema in total, but it looked nice. The taste was really nice, although quite light, not quite unexpected from a light roast. When I cleaned up I noticed the puck had shattered with two large cracks going right through it. I haven&#8217;t seen that earlier.

For the second shot, an hour or so later so that the Pavoni had had a long time to cool down, the crema was identical. The cup and group head had been preheated just as in the previous shot and the Rocky was still dialled in at 4. The pull required was still nice, strong and steady. I believe it took about as long time, some 20-25 seconds. The taste was more burnt, which was expected from the very dark roast I had the first day. My conclusion from day 1 remains, I had overdone it with preset 1. This worries me as my variant of Randy&#8217;s famous &#8220;preset 10&#8243; was also quite dark, but I&#8217;ll come back to that one another day. This one should be at its prime now and was quite bitter, actually. Much of that &#8220;wow&#8221;-taste is gone.

Oh well, tomorrow I have some new grinds ready. I haven&#8217;t heared back from Risteriet yet regarding a tamper and some fresh green beans, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll get back to me in no time. In the meanwhile, there is still loads to learn. For this dark coffee I certainly need to froth some milk. Now, how do I do that? <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Note to self: this one will be called &#8220;the big eared poodle&#8221;, my first latte art creation. <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
