I wonder if [Jonathan Schwartz][1] will comment on todays news (<a href="http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/041001muzzlesun/" class="broken_link">ITworld</a> (via [ZDNet blog][2] (via Schwartz, actually <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> )) and [Computerworld][3] (via [Linux Today][4])) that HP doesn&#8217;t like him blogging negatively about them. I remember reading the discussed entry and I actually agreed with Schwartz in much of it. But it&#8217;s interesting as this is what, in my view, blogs do well: give people&#8217;s opinion a place, without having corporations interfering. For instance, I&#8217;m buying a Canon EOS 20D camera, and I read reviews by obviously biassed reviewers, but also lots of blog entries. And after having read enough, I actually ordered it without having had it in my hand, I&#8217;m that confident that this will be a great camera. It goes the other way around too, if I buy something on eBay and I get screwed by a seller (no, I don&#8217;t have any particulars in mind <img src='http://blog.saers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ), I will be sure to report it, and not particularly by negative feedback. This is what blogs do well. And I&#8217;m sorry for HP if they don&#8217;t appreciate it. But hey, they got heaps of PR on it. And it&#8217;d be nice to hear Jonathan&#8217;s opinion.
